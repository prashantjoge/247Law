{"Prompt": "I think I may have been caught speeding by a camera, how can I challenge this ?", "Response": "If you have been caught speeding you may receive a Notice of Intended Prosecution within 14 days of the offence. If you have not received this it is unlikely that you will face prosecution for the offence. If you have been caught speeding, the prosecution must prove that the camera has received Home Office approval; that on the day you were allegedly speeding that the camera was working properly; that the road you were driving on had a speed limit and that you were the driver of the vehicle. If a prosecution for speeding is brought against you, then you can challenge it on these grounds. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you. We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish"}

{"Prompt": "I may have been caught speeding by a police officer, but the officer was alone, am I likely to be prosecuted ?", "Response": "If the police officer was using a speed camera which showed that you were driving above the speed limit then there is no requirement for an additional police officer to be present. If the officer was not using a speed camera or other recording equipment an additional police officer needs to be present to corroborate that you were driving above the speed limit before you can be prosecuted."}
{"Prompt": "A police officer stopped me for speeding, how long do I have to wait before they prosecute me ?", "Response": "If you have been stopped by a police officer, then they have 6 months to bring the case against you to court. It is likely that you can challenge the allegation if the police do not present your case to the court within this time. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you. We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish."}
{"Prompt": "A police officer has stopped me for speeding. Do I have to say anything ?", "Response": "Yes, you are required to identify yourself to the officer and confirm to whom the vehicle belongs.

{"Prompt": "What is a Notice of Intended Prosecution?", "Response": "You will receive a Notice of Intended Prosecution if the police believe that your vehicle was involved in an offence and the driver was not stopped at the time.

The notice means that the police are considering whether to commence criminal proceedings against the driver of the vehicle."}
{"Prompt": "I have just received a Notice of Intended Prosecution, what do I do now?", "Response": "You need to provide the details of the driver of the vehicle within 28 days. If you do not return this information within 28 days you may commit an offence of failure to furnish information."}

{"Prompt": "Do I have to disclose who was driving at the time of the alleged offence?", "Response": "Yes. Failure to disclose who was driving is a criminal offence."}
{"Prompt": "I have received a Notice of Intended Prosecution but I do not know who the driver is, what should I do?", "Response": "The court can amend minor errors on the Notice of Intent to Prosecute, such as your name or address if they are small mistakes.

{"Prompt": "I have just received a Notice of Intend to Prosecute. Will I have to go to court?", "Response": "Not necessarily. Depending on the seriousness of the allegation you may be offered a Fixed Penalty Notice, Speed Awareness Course or the option to plead guilty by post. If you wish to challenge the allegation it is likely that you will need to defend your case in court. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you. We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish."}
{"Prompt": "I have just received a Notice of Intended Prosecution, do I need a lawyer?", "Response": "Not necessarily. If the Notice of Intended Prosecution alleges a more serious offence or if you have previous motoring convictions it is advisable to contact a lawyer. If you have never committed a motoring offence before, if the offence alleged in the Notice of Intended Prosecution is less serious and you do not want to challenge the facts alleged you may not need a lawyer."}
{"Prompt": "I have just received a Notice of Intended Prosecution, what documents do I need to return?", "Response": "Unless the Notice of Intended Prosecution requests otherwise, you do not need to send any money or your driving licence at this point. All you need to do is complete the form with your details and confirming the identity of the driver of the vehicle at the time of the alleged offence."}
{"Prompt": "I have completed and returned the Notice of Intended Prosecution, what happens now?", "Response": "Usually, for a minor speeding offence you will receive a Fixed Penalty Notice which offers you the opportunity to accept a fine of £60 and three penalty points on your licence. You can reject this Fixed Penalty Notice and challenge the offence in the Magistrates’ Court. If your speed was excessive (over 40% of the speed limit) you may receive a summons to attend the Magistrates’ Court."}
{"Prompt": "To where should I return my completed Notice of Intended Prosecution form?", "Response": "Your completed document should be returned to the local authority dealing with alleged motoring offences. The Notice of Intended Prosecution should state where to return the forms."}

{"Prompt": "I have received a Court Summons, what can I do?", "Response": "You have three main options in response to receiving the court summons: 1. Plead not guilty. 2. Plead guilty by post and submit a plea of mitigation. 3. Plead guilty and attend the court hearing with your plea of mitigation."}
{"Prompt": "I have received a court summons, but have not received a Notice of Intended Prosecution, is this valid?", "Response": "If you were stopped by the police at the time of the alleged offence and told about a possible conviction then it is not necessary for you to receive a Notice of Intended Prosecution."}
{"Prompt": "The details in my Court Summons are incorrect, is it invalid?", "Response": "Simple mistakes such as an error in your vehicle details or personal information can be changed by the court and will not invalidate the court summons. However, if there is a large error which affects your ability to defend your case the court may dismiss your prosecution."}
{"Prompt": "My court summons asks me to attend a court which is not in my local area. Can I change the location?", "Response": "Not usually. Only in exceptional circumstances will the hearing take place outside of the local area where the alleged offence occurred."}
{"Prompt": "Can I plead guilty by post?", "Response": "Your summons will state whether or not you can plead guilty by post. If you face disqualification or the offence is more serious then you may be required to attend the court hearing."}
{"Prompt": "What happens if I plead guilty by post?", "Response": "If you plead guilty by post you can send a letter of mitigation to the court and they will pass a sentence upon you in your absence."}
{"Prompt": "My letter of mitigation has been rejected, what do I do now?", "Response": "The court may reject your letter of mitigation because they are considering disqualification or because your letter is read as a not guilty plea. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you. We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish."} 
{"Prompt": "Is it better for me to attend the court in person rather than plead guilty by post?", "Response": "It depends on the facts of your case.

We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish."}
{"Prompt": "What is a Speed Awareness Course?", "Response": "Sometimes a driver may be offered the chance to attend a Speed Awareness Course instead of accepting the Fixed Penalty Notice. The titles and content of these courses varies regionally. They are courses held in local centres designed to educate the driver about the dangers of speeding and to encourage the driver not to commit a motoring offence again."}
{"Prompt": "Should I attend a Speed Awareness Course?", "Response": "This depends upon your personal situation. If you accept a Speed Awareness Course you will not face further prosecution or receive penalty points or a fine for the alleged offence."}
{"Prompt": "I have not been offered a Speed Awareness Course; can I request it instead of my Fixed Penalty Notice?", "Response": "No. Local authorities run Speed Awareness Courses for offences of different seriousness and you will be notified if you are eligible to attend instead of receiving a Fixed Penalty Notice."}

{"Prompt": "For how long will I be disqualified?", "Response": "Usually driving disqualifications last between 7-56 days. In more serious cases a disqualification could last up to 120 days."}
{"Prompt": "Can I pay a larger fine or receive more penalty points on my licence rather than face disqualification?", "Response": "The court will consider your letter of mitigation when sentencing you, as well as your personal circumstances. Therefore, it is possible that the court may impose a higher fine and more penalty points instead of disqualification. However, this is not guaranteed, particularly if you face disqualification because you have obtained 12 penalty points over three years."}
{"Prompt": "What is a plea of mitigation?", "Response": "A plea of mitigation states all the reasons why the court should impose a lenient sentence upon you. You can make your plea of mitigation in court in person or by sending the court a letter of mitigation when pleading guilty by post. Generate your letter of mitigation here."}
{"Prompt": "What is the difference between a totting up mandatory disqualification and a discretionary disqualification?", "Response":A "mandatory disqualification arises when you obtain 12 penalty points on your driving licence over three years. The court is required to disqualify you from driving for six months unless it would cause you exceptional hardship. When your driving licence is returned to you it will be clean of any penalty points. A discretionary disqualification will be given by the courts if you have seriously violated the speed limit and they believe it is appropriate to impose a driving ban. This driving ban can be shorter or longer than six months depending on the seriousness of the offence and the licence may be returned to you with previous penalty points still valid."}
{"Prompt": "What is exceptional hardship?", "Response": "There is no set definition of exceptional hardship as it varies between cases. However, you will be required to show that disqualification would have far greater implications for you than it would for any other person facing disqualification. The fact that you will lose your job is usually insufficient. If you have relied on exceptional hardship in the past three years then you cannot rely on these facts again."}
{"Prompt": "I have been disqualified from driving. How can I get my licence back?", "Response": "There is a limited chance that you can appeal your disqualification. If you have been disqualified for two years or more you can apply to the Magistrates’ Court to restore your driving licence. The Magistrates’ Court will only remove your disqualification in limited circumstances. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you. We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish."} 
{"Prompt": "Do I need a solicitor or barrister?", "Response": "If your case goes to court, you face disqualification or your case involves technical legal arguments, it is advisable to instruct a lawyer. However, you are not required to have a solicitor or barrister and you are allowed present your own case in court. In many cases defendants are confident enough to defend their case and discuss the facts; however, a legal representative is advisable to address the legal arguments which arise. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you. We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish."} 
{"Prompt": "Once I’ve passed my driving test again will there be penalty points on my licence?", "Response": "If you were disqualified because you obtained six penalty points during your probationary period then your new licence will be clean. However, if you were disqualified in other circumstances penalty points may remain valid on your new licence."}
{"Prompt": "Can the police stop a vehicle for any reason?", "Response":: "Yes, the police can stop a vehicle for any reason. If they ask you to stop, you should always pull over when it’s safe to do so. It's against the law to not stop when asked by the police."}
{"Prompt": "What should I do if the police ask me to stop while driving?", "Response":: "If the police ask you to stop while driving, you should always pull over when it’s safe to do so. You’re breaking the law if you do not comply with their request to stop."}

{"Prompt": "What happens if I refuse to take a breath test?", "Response": "If you refuse to take a breath test, or fail to supply a sample of breath and do not have a ‘reasonable excuse’, you can be arrested. A reasonable excuse could be a genuine physical or mental condition that prevents you from giving a sample."}
{"Prompt": "What constitutes a reasonable excuse for not providing a breath sample?", "Response": "A reasonable excuse for not providing a breath sample could be a genuine physical or mental condition that stops you from giving a sample."}
{"Prompt": "How soon will I know the result of a breath test?", "Response": "The breath test gives a result straight away."}

{"Prompt": "Can the police ask me to take other tests if they suspect I'm under the influence?", "Response": "Yes, if the officer thinks you're under the influence of alcohol or drugs, they can ask you to take a drug test or do a physical test, such as a ‘field impairment test’, which might include walking in a straight line then turning around and walking back."}
{"Prompt": "What happens if I fail a drug test or a field impairment test?", "Response": "You can be arrested if you fail a drug test or a field impairment test."}
{"Prompt": "Can I drive my car immediately after failing a breath test?", "Response": "No, if you fail a breath test, you cannot drive your car until you’re sober. You can ask someone else to collect your car for you."}
{"Prompt": "A police officer issued me with a provisional fixed penalty notice. To which police station should I surrender my driving licence?", "Response": "The provisional fixed penalty notice should tell you which police station you need to present your documents to. It is usually the police station nearest to the location where the alleged offence occurred."}
{"Prompt": "What should I do if my vehicle has a fault, like a broken brake light?", "Response": "If your vehicle has a fault such as a broken brake light, the police may issue you a ‘vehicle defect rectification notice’. You'll need to get the vehicle fixed and provide proof of the repair, like a receipt from a mechanic, to the police."}
{"Prompt": "What happens to the penalty points on my licence if I am disqualified for totting up 12 penalty points?", "Response": "If you are disqualified from driving due because you have obtained 12 penalty points over three years then all penalty points are erased and you will have a clean licence once the disqualification period expires."}
{"Prompt": "I am going to have 12 penalty points on my driving licence; will I be disqualified from driving?", "Response": "Usually, if you incur 12 penalty points on your driving licence across three years the court will disqualify you from driving for at least six months. However, the court may not disqualify you if it would cause exceptional hardship on you or a person dependent upon you. It must be an exceptional reason and it is not enough that you would lose your job for example. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you. We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish."}
