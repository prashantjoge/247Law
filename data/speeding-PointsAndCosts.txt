WHAT tCLASSES AS A SPEEDING OFFENCE IN THE UK?
Speeding seems straightforward on the surface: if you drive over the speed limit, you're speeding. However, the reality is a bit more nuanced. In the UK, speeding offences are categorised into three bands for fines - A, B and C - based on how much you exceed the speed limit.

SPEEDING BANDS EXPLAINED
Band A: this is for minor offences, where your speed is just over the limit.
Band B: this category is for more serious cases, where the speed is significantly over the limit but not extreme.
Band C: this is the most severe category, reserved for instances where the speed is dangerously high, far exceeding the limit.
The band you fall into will dictate not only the fine you'll receive but also the number of points or disqualification against yourdriving licence. Understanding these bands is crucial for grasping the gravity of a speeding offence and its subsequent penalties.

HOW MUCH WILL A SPEEDING FINE COST ME?
One of the most immediate concerns after being caught speeding is the financial impact. In the UK, the cost of a speeding fine is not a flat rate; it's calculated based on your weekly income. This means the wealthier you are, the more you'll have to pay. However, there are some limits in place.

CALCULATING YOUR FINE
Band A: fines start at 50% of your weekly income, ranging up to 75%.
Band B: fines begin at 100% of your weekly income, with a range up to 125%.
Band C: the fines start at 150% of your weekly income and can go up to 175%.
MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM LIMITS
The minimum fine you can expect to pay is £100.
The maximum fine for speeding on regular roads is £1,000.
If you were caught speeding on a motorway, the maximum fine could escalate to £2,500.
FIRST-TIME OFFENDERS
If you're a first-time offender and your speeding wasn't excessive, you may be offered the option to attend a speed awareness course instead of receiving a fine and points on your licence. This is not a guarantee but is often available as an alternative subject to the police forces discretion.

HOW MANY POINTS WILL BE ADDED TO MY LICENCE FOR SPEEDING?
While the financial cost of a speeding ticket is often the first concern that comes to mind, the long-term impact of points on your driving licence can be equally, if not more, consequential. Points can affect your insurance premiums and, if accumulated, can even lead to a driving ban.

POINTS BASED ON SPEEDING BANDS
Band A: typically, you'll receive three points on your licence.
Band B: you could receive between four and six points or disqualification 7-28 days
Band C: in the most severe cases, you could receive six points or even face disqualification for a period of up to 56 days
LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES
Accumulating points on your licence can have several long-term effects, including:

Increased insurance premiums
Risk of losing your licence if you accumulate 12 or more points within a three-year period
Employment implications, especially if your job requires a clean driving record
SPECIAL CASES: NEW DRIVERS
For new drivers who are within two years of passing their driving test, accumulating six or more points can result in an immediate revocation of their driving licence

Understanding the points system and its long-term implications is crucial for every driver. It's not just about the immediate fine; it's about the broader impact on your life and future driving career.

IS A SPEED AWARENESS COURSE A CHEAPER OPTION?
If you've been caught speeding for the first time and your offence is not considered excessive, you might be offered the option to attend a Speed Awareness Course. This alternative to a fine and points on your licence is often seen as a more educational and potentially cost-effective solution.

WHAT IS A SPEED AWARENESS COURSE?
A Speed Awareness Course is a workshop designed to educate drivers about the dangers of speeding and to promote safer driving. The course usually lasts around four hours and covers various aspects of speed management and road safety.

COST COMPARISON
The cost of a Speed Awareness Course generally ranges between £80 and £100.

When compared to a minimum fine of £100 plus the potential increase in insurance premiums due to points on your licence, the course often comes out as the more cost-effective option.

ELIGIBILITY AND LIMITATIONS
Not everyone is eligible for a Speed Awareness Course. Eligibility often depends on the police force and the severity of the speeding offence, and whether you’ve attended a course within the last three years.

Completing the course means you avoid points on your licence, but you can’t repeatedly opt for this alternative.

THE BIGGER PICTURE
While the immediate cost may be similar to the minimum fine, the absence of points on your licence could save you money in the long run, especially when it comes to insurance premiums.

WHAT HAPPENS IF A NEW DRIVER IS CAUGHT SPEEDING?
For new drivers, the consequences of speeding can be particularly severe. The rules are stricter, and the penalties can have a lasting impact on your early driving career. Understanding these rules is crucial for anyone who has recently passed their driving test.

THE SIX-POINT RULE
If you’re a new driver and you accumulate six or more penalty points within the first two years of passing your driving test, you will be disqualified from driving. Your driving licence will be revoked, and you’ll have to retake both the theory and practical tests to regain it.

WHY THE STRICTER RULES?
The rationale behind this is simple: new drivers are generally less experienced and, therefore, more likely to be involved in accidents. The stricter penalties serve as a deterrent and aim to encourage safer driving habits from the outset.

THE REVOCATION PROCESS
Once your licence is revoked, you’ll have to apply for a new provisional licence. You’ll need to pass both the theory and practical driving tests again. Only then can you drive unaccompanied. Until that point, you’ll be back to square one, driving only under supervision and displaying ‘L’ plates.

THE LONG-TERM IMPACT
Having your licence revoked can have long-term implications, including higher insurance premiums when you do get back on the road.

It can also affect employment opportunities, especially for jobs that require a clean driving record.

DO ALL SPEED CAMERAS FLASH WHEN THEY CATCH YOU?
The moment of uncertainty when you pass a speed camera and wonder whether it flashed can be nerve-wracking. Understanding how different types of speed cameras operate can help clarify whether you’ve been caught in the act.

TYPES OF SPEED CAMERAS
Fixed cameras: these are permanent installations on the road. The most common types are Gatso and Truvelo.
Mobile cameras: these are temporary installations or can be operated from vehicles parked on the side of the road.

TO FLASH OR NOT TO FLASH?
Gatso cameras: these cameras do flash as they take a photo of your rear number plate.
Truvelo cameras: these cameras do not flash. They are designed to capture the speed without alerting the driver.
Mobile cameras: these use lasers to track your speed and generally do not flash.
HOW TO IDENTIFY THEM
Gatso cameras are usually yellow boxes on a pole and are rear-facing.
Truvelo cameras are forward-facing and can capture the driver’s face, but they are less conspicuous.
Mobile cameras are often operated from vans parked on the side of the road, making them harder to spot.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
If you’ve been caught by a speed camera, you can expect to receive a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) within 14 days of the offence. If you are the registered keepers This will be a Section 172 Notice, which you must return within 28 days to inform the police who was driving the car at the time of the offence.

HOW CAN I CHECK THE NUMBER OF POINTS ON MY LICENCE?
After discussing the various aspects of speeding offences, fines and cameras, you might be wondering how to check the current status of your driving licence. Knowing the number of points on your licence is crucial for understanding your standing as a driver and for making informed decisions on the road.

The UK government provides a dedicated online service that allows you to check the number of points on your licence. All you need to do is enter some personal details, and you'll have access to your driving record.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW
Points on your licence can affect your insurance premiums.
Accumulating too many points can lead to a driving ban.
Some employment opportunities may require a clean driving record.

The online service doesn't just show the number of points; it also provides other valuable information such as:
The type of licence you hold
Any restrictions or endorsements
The expiry date of your licence
It's good practice to regularly check the status of your licence, especially if you've recently been involved in a traffic offence. Being proactive can help you take corrective measures before things escalate.

HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO RECEIVE A SPEEDING TICKET?
Normally, you can expect to receive two key notices within 14 days of the incident if you are teh registered keeper, if your lease the vehicle or is finance it will go to those companies initially. The first is the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP), which serves as a formal indication that you're being considered for prosecution due to a speeding offence. must be returned within 28 days to confirm who was driving the vehicle at the time of the offence.
Once the Section NIP/172 Notice is returned, you'll either receive a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) or a letter instructing you to attend court, depending on the severity of the offence. The letter may also offer you the option of taking a speed awareness course as an alternative to receiving points on your licence. The timeline for these subsequent steps can vary but usually follows within a few weeks after the Section 172 Notice is returned.

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET SIX POINTS ON YOUR LICENCE WITHIN TWO YEARS OF PASSING YOUR TEST?
UNDERSTANDING PENALTY POINTS
Penalty points are punishments for motoring offences, given in the form of points on your driving licence. They serve as an official record of your driving behaviour, impacting everything from your insurance premiums to your ability to rent a car. If you accrue too many, you may be banned from driving altogether and see your licence removed.
The number of points given varies based on the severity of the offence. Some common examples of motoring offences and their associated penalties in the UK include:

Speeding can be punished with three to six points on your licence, depending on how far over the speed limit you were driving.
Using a mobile phone while driving could land you six points as well as a fixed fine. It is illegal to hold a phone or a sat nav while driving – you must have hands-free access.
Drink driving is one of the UK's more severely punished motoring offences - you could face a fine, a driving ban or even a prison sentence.
Careless driving can attract three to nine penalty points. It includes a range of driving behaviours deemed as showing a lack of attention or consideration for other road users. For instance, tailgating or lane hogging can lead to points.
Failing to stop after an accident is an offence. You must also give your details to the other person involved, or you could receive five to ten penalty points.
Infringements are not limited to the above examples; there is a long list of potential offences that can result in penalty points. By maintaining an awareness of these offences and their consequences, and by driving responsibly, you can help ensure that your licence remains clean and your insurance premiums stay manageable.

PROVISIONAL LICENCES
A provisional licence enables you to drive under the supervision of an instructor or another qualified driver. Even at this early stage, your driving behaviour can lead to penalty points. If you accrue six or more points on your provisional licence, the repercussions could be significant.
When you finally pass your first driving test, your provisional licence will be replaced by a full driving licence. Any points you have amassed during your learning phase do not disappear; they carry over to your full licence. This means you will need to be extra vigilant when driving.

UNDERSTANDING THE SIX-POINT LIMIT
For new drivers, the first two years post-test are functionally a probationary period. During this time, new drivers are subject to a six-point limit. Accumulate six points within this period, and you could face having your licence revoked by the DVLA. It is important to note that points are counted from the date of the offence, not from when they are officially added to your licence, and so they will remain on your licence from this date.

LICENCE REVOCATION
The revocation of a driving licence is one of the more severe outcomes for breaching the six-point limit, and whether the court decides to carry this out will depend on the nature of your offence. A revoked licence legally prohibits you from driving, marking a sudden end to your motoring freedom. It is vital to distinguish revocation from disqualification - in a revocation scenario, you are not banned from driving indefinitely. Instead, you must reapply for your provisional licence and pass both of your driving tests again, which can be time-consuming and expensive.
If you have had your licence revoked, the first step you should take is to apply for a new provisional licence via the DVLA website. Once you have your new provisional licence, you need to arrange your theory and practical driving tests. This can be a demoralising process, but you must do this if you wish to recover your right to drive.
Passing your driving test will help you to get back on the road, but you will still need to consider the repercussions of committing a criminal motoring offence - the points may stay on your licence, and court, police and insurance companies may keep a close eye on you, meaning penalties for further infractions may be more severe.

PROACTIVE MEASURES TO AVOID PENALTY POINTS
Avoiding a situation where your licence gets revoked starts with driving responsibly. Here are a few strategies to steer clear of penalty points:

Understand the Highway Code: the more familiar you are with the rules, the less likely you are to breach them.
Promote safe driving: adhere to speed limits, always wear your seatbelt, resist the temptation to use your mobile phone whilst driving, and never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Consider taking an advanced driving course: beyond helping you become a more confident and competent driver, advanced lessons often offer insights into defensive driving tactics that could prove invaluable.
Maintain your vehicle: regular vehicle checks and maintenance can prevent breakdowns and faults, which might lead to offences. Simple actions like checking your lights, tyre tread depth, and oil levels can make a big difference.
Plan your journey: knowing your route beforehand reduces stress and allows you to focus on driving safely, reducing the risk of speeding or making risky manoeuvres.

THE IMPACT OF INSURANCE PREMIUMS
Car insurance is a crucial aspect of driving, offering financial protection against physical damage or bodily injury resulting from traffic collisions, and against liability that could also arise from incidents in a vehicle. One factor that significantly influences car insurance premiums is your driving record, with penalty points playing a crucial role.
Insurance companies calculate premiums based on risk assessment. Drivers with points on their licence are deemed higher risk due to past infringements, suggesting a potential propensity to violate traffic laws or get involved in accidents. Thus, they are more likely to make a claim, leading to increased insurance premiums.
Accumulating points on your licence could see your insurance cost rise substantially. Some insurers may even decline to offer coverage if they consider you a high-risk driver. This could limit your options and force you to seek specialised insurance providers who typically charge higher premiums.
The consequences of acquiring penalty points extend beyond immediate fines or potential revocation of your licence. They can have a lasting impact on the cost of your car insurance, affecting your finances for years.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU EXCEED THE 6-POINT LIMIT?
If you find yourself in the unfortunate situation of exceeding the six-point limit within two years of passing your test, do not panic. While it is a serious situation that may lead to your licence being revoked, it is not the end of the road. There are steps you can take to navigate this predicament.
One of the most important things to do is seek legal advice. Navigating the legal intricacies surrounding motoring offences can be challenging, and expert guidance from a specialist motoring offences solicitor can be invaluable. Speaking to a legal expert can help you understand your rights, the potential penalties, and any possible defences you might have.

HOW TO AVOID A DRIVING BAN WITH AN EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP PLEA
UNDERSTANDING DRIVING BANS
A driving ban or disqualification is a legal directive that temporarily or permanently revokes an individual's driving licence, thereby prohibiting them from operating a motor vehicle on public roads in the UK. Driving bans are typically issued by courts following serious motoring offences, such as drink-driving, careless driving, or dangerous driving.
The duration of the ban can vary based on the severity of the offence and the driver's past record. For less serious offences, the ban might be a matter of months, while serious or repeat offences can result in a ban lasting several years or, in extreme cases, a lifetime disqualification, albeit rare.
One such type of ban that UK drivers frequently face is a 'totting-up' ban. This is a term used in the UK to refer to a driving disqualification resulting from a driver accumulating 12 or more penalty points within a span of three years. The duration of the ban is contingent on the severity of the offences committed and typically ranges from six months to two years.
If a driver is at risk of being disqualified from driving due to totting up, they may be able to argue exceptional hardship to reduce or remove the ban imposed.

WHAT IS EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP?
The term exceptional hardship refers to situations that extend beyond the regular inconvenience or difficulty that a driving ban might cause. These are circumstances that have a significant and extraordinary impact on an individual's life. Examples might include severe financial consequences leading to insolvency, job loss with no feasible alternatives, or an impactful detriment to someone who relies on your ability to drive, like a family member with serious health conditions.
Defining exceptional hardship can be a bit nebulous as the circumstances vary significantly from case to case. However, some situations are generally recognised as demonstrating exceptional hardship:

Severe financial consequences: if a driving ban would cause severe financial hardship such as bankruptcy or foreclosure, you might argue exceptional hardship. For instance, if you run your own business and the success of the business is significantly reliant on your ability to drive, a ban could lead to its collapse, and subsequently, financial ruin.
Loss of employment: if a driving ban results in losing your job, and it can be shown that finding alternative employment is unlikely or not feasible, you might be able to claim exceptional hardship. However, remember that the loss of employment does not automatically constitute exceptional hardship - it must be proven that the loss of your job would have repercussions beyond the usual impacts.
Impact on dependents: if you have a dependent, like a child or elderly relative, who relies on your ability to drive for their wellbeing, you may have grounds for an exceptional hardship plea. This might include driving them to medical appointments or providing care that cannot be fulfilled by public transport or other reasonable means.
Medical reasons: if you or a family member has a medical condition that requires frequent hospital visits, or there is a need for rapid transport in case of emergencies, the loss of your driving licence could be argued as causing exceptional hardship.
Lack of reasonable transportation alternatives: if you live in a remote location with limited access to public transport and you rely on your vehicle for essential activities such as grocery shopping, this might be considered exceptional hardship.
It is vital to understand that these examples are not guarantees of a successful exceptional hardship plea. Each case is evaluated on its own merits, and it is the court's discretion that ultimately decides whether the circumstances described qualify as exceptional hardship. It is highly recommended to seek legal advice when considering an exceptional hardship plea.

AM I ELIGIBLE TO MAKE AN EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP PLEA?
The eligibility to submit an exceptional hardship plea is not universal for all drivers facing a ban. Exceptional hardship arguments have specific criteria for eligibility, including being at risk of a totting-up disqualification due to accruing 12 or more penalty points, and having exceptional hardship conditions. It is critical to understand that mere inconvenience due to a driving ban does not warrant eligibility to plead exceptional hardship. The hardship must extend beyond the person involved and encompass others who are dependent on the individual's ability to drive.

WHAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP?
It is crucial to differentiate between inconvenience and exceptional hardship. The loss of a driving licence naturally leads to difficulties such as dependence on public transportation; however, these do not qualify as exceptional hardship. Similarly, the potential loss of employment may not always meet the criteria, especially if other employment options are available. Each case is considered based on its unique circumstances, but in general, typical hardships that are reasonably expected do not fall under the umbrella of 'exceptional'.

WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF MAKING AN EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP PLEA?
If you meet the eligibility criteria, the initial step is to consult a specialist motoring offences solicitor - such as those at JMW Solicitors. Our solicitors' proficiency and understanding of the legal process are indispensable for a successful plea.
Your solicitor will help you gather all necessary evidence to substantiate your claim once you decide to proceed. This evidence might include financial records, medical reports, or support letters. Subsequently, they will assist you in preparing for the court appearance, advising on what to anticipate and the optimal way to present your case.
On your court hearing day, either you or your solicitor, or both, will present your case to the magistrates. The court will scrutinise your plea and make their judgment based on the evidence and arguments laid before them.

POST-PLEA SCENARIOS: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER MAKING AN EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP PLEA?
Once your case has been presented, the court may either grant or reject your exceptional hardship plea. A successful plea might allow you to retain your driving privileges or lead to a reduced disqualification period. Alternatively, a rejected plea would result in the enforcement of the totting-up ban.
Irrespective of the outcome, successfully arguing exceptional hardship will not remove penalty points from your licence. Furthermore, the same grounds for exceptional hardship cannot be used again in court within a three-year period.

WHAT ARE EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP DRIVING BAN EXAMPLES?
A driving ban can have severe consequences on an individual's life, especially when it results in job loss, an inability to care for family members, or restricted mobility due to health issues. Understanding the intricacies of exceptional hardship through driving ban examples can help you navigate these challenging circumstances and potentially avoid or reduce the impact of a driving disqualification. 
So, what are exceptional hardship driving ban examples and how can they be used in court? In this blog post, we explore the legal framework, types of arguments, and real-life cases.

SHORT SUMMARY
Understand the concept of exceptional hardship and its legal framework.
Gather evidence to demonstrate how a driving ban will have an impact on dependents, employment, health & mobility issues.
Engage professional advice for successful application and consider appeal or removal options if unsuccessful.
UNDERSTANDING EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP
Exceptional hardship is a legal argument used to attempt to avoid or reduce a driving disqualification due to accumulating penalty points, which may result in external suffering for any dependents of the driver. The primary concern of exceptional hardship applications is to assess the impact of a potential driving ban of at least six months on those who rely on the applicant and their driving licence.
Drivers facing a disqualification may argue exceptional hardship in court, but they must support their claims with sound evidence, testimony, and supporting evidence.
Evidence must be provided to prove an ‘exceptional hardship’ if a driving disqualification is to occur. The evidence must suggest a ‘balance of probabilities’, meaning that there should be clear signs of this exceptional hardship for the driver or those they are responsible for.
When submitting an application for exceptional hardship, it is essential to provide truthful and fair information, and be adequately prepared with supporting evidence.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The totting-up system, as prescribed by UK law, provides the legal basis for the exceptional hardship argument.
The act requires drivers with 12 or more penalty points to attend a court hearing and face a totting-up ban. Engaging the expertise of a qualified and professional motoring offence specialist can significantly increase the chances of successfully presenting a compelling case for avoiding a driving ban.

WHAT IS EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP ON A DRIVING LICENCE WITH 12 POINTS?
Having 12 or more penalty points on a driving licence within any three-year period can be a cause of significant disruption to an individual's life. As such, applications for exceptional hardship may be submitted in such circumstances in order to allow the court to consider whether disqualification from driving is warranted.
The court will consider the individual's circumstances and the impact that disqualification would have on them, their family and their employment. If the court is satisfied that the individual would suffer exceptional hardship, they may allow the individual to keep the licence.

TYPES OF EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP ARGUMENTS
Various exceptional hardship arguments can be used in court, such as employment-related hardships, family and dependents' needs, and health and mobility issues. These arguments help demonstrate the potential negative consequences that a driving ban would have on the individual or their dependents.
It is essential to present a solid case backed by substantial evidence to ensure the court considers the argument and potentially avoids the driving ban.

EMPLOYMENT-RELATED HARDSHIPS
Employment-related hardships can include job loss or difficulty in meeting financial obligations. An example of an employment-related hardship argument could involve a driver's inability to fulfil work obligations due to geographical and public transport restrictions.
The court may take into consideration the potential work-related implications, especially for managers, key employees or business owners. A career that is essential for the health or safety of others may also be considered an exceptional hardship argument.

FAMILY AND DEPENDENTS' NEEDS
Family and dependents' needs may include caring for relatives or needing to transport children to school. The court may be more sympathetic to an exceptional hardship application if the applicant has dependents who rely on them for support that requires access to a car.
Families and dependents may require basic necessities such as food, shelter and healthcare, as well as emotional and financial support.

HEALTH AND MOBILITY ISSUES
Health and mobility issues can include physical or mental health conditions that hinder the individual's ability to operate a vehicle safely. Severe health issues that could impede mobility can be considered an exceptional hardship argument.
Such issues may have a significant impact on the individual's life, and a driving ban may exacerbate these challenges, making it crucial to present a strong case for exceptional hardship in court.

PREPARING AN EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP CASE
To prepare an exceptional hardship case, it is crucial to gather evidence and seek legal advice and representation. This process ensures that the case is thoroughly prepared and presented with relevant supporting evidence, increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome.
Inadequate preparation may lead to a dismissal of the case and a ban being imposed.

GATHERING EVIDENCE
The driver must provide evidence to the court to demonstrate exceptional hardship, which can be either emotional or financial in nature. Examples of evidence include proof of impact on dependents, medical records, financial documents, and other relevant personal background circumstances.
It is also beneficial to submit supporting letters from those who will be affected by the disqualification, such as one's employer, partner, or staff members, to bolster the application.

LEGAL ADVICE AND REPRESENTATION
Enlisting the assistance of a solicitor or barrister to guide you through the process of constructing an argument for exceptional hardship, preparing documents and organising evidence to support your case is vital. Legal representation from specialist motoring offence solicitors can guarantee that any claim is fully prepared and presented to the courts in a way that meets their standards.
Furthermore, engaging the expertise of a qualified and professional motoring offence specialist can significantly increase the chances of successfully presenting a compelling case for avoiding a driving ban.

COURT PROCEEDINGS FOR EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP APPLICATIONS
The court proceedings for exceptional hardship applications involve attending the hearing and presenting the case. It is essential for the applicant to attend the hearing, as it is their opportunity to present their case and provide evidence to support their exceptional hardship argument.
Ensuring that the case is prepared and presented professionally in court by lawyers who specialise in this area is crucial to enhance the likelihood of keeping the driving licence.

ATTENDING THE HEARING
Attending the hearing is of utmost importance for an exceptional hardship application, as it is the opportunity for the applicant to present their case and provide evidence to support their exceptional hardship argument. The objective of attending the hearing for an exceptional hardship application is to present the case. Failure to attend the hearing may result in a dismissal of the case and the imposition of a driving ban.

PRESENTING THE CASE
Constructing a strong case for an exceptional hardship application is of great importance, as it involves assembling a compelling argument backed by reliable evidence that the applicant's circumstances are extraordinary and that lifting the driving ban would bring about considerable external suffering to dependents. Medical records, letters from employers, and letters from family members can be employed to support the case.

OUTCOMES AND CONSEQUENCES
Understanding the potential outcomes and consequences of exceptional hardship applications is crucial for anyone facing a driving ban. If the application is successful, the driving ban will be rescinded, allowing the individual to continue driving and avoiding the negative consequences of the ban.
However, if the application is unsuccessful, the driving ban will be imposed, potentially resulting in job loss, loss of accommodation, and other severe consequences.

SUCCESSFUL APPLICATIONS
A successful exceptional hardship application can significantly impact an individual's life, as it allows them to continue driving and avoid the numerous negative consequences of a driving ban. The court may choose to reduce the disqualification period or avoid the driving ban altogether, depending on the evidence presented and the circumstances of the case.
It is important to note that the success of an exceptional hardship application is not guaranteed and depends on the strength of the argument and the evidence provided.

UNSUCCESSFUL APPLICATIONS
Unsuccessful exceptional hardship applications will result in the driving ban being imposed. The consequences of a driving ban can be severe, including loss of employment, livelihood and home. It could even cause redundancies if the ban adversely affects one's business.
Additionally, it may leave an individual unable to provide care for a relative or family member. In such cases, it may be possible to appeal the decision or seek an early removal of driving disqualification.

WHAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP?
Real-life examples of exceptional hardship cases can illustrate how the argument is used in court and the potential outcomes. For instance, a driver who has accumulated 12 penalty points and faces a ban might argue that their job requires them to drive daily, and a ban would result in loss of employment and subsequent financial hardship.
Another example could be a driver who needs to drive to provide medical care for a family member, and a ban would make it impossible for them to continue providing this care.
Understanding these real-life examples can help drivers facing a ban prepare their exceptional hardship argument and increase their chances of success.
Understanding exceptional hardship driving ban examples is crucial for anyone facing a driving disqualification due to accumulating penalty points. By familiarising yourself with the legal framework, types of exceptional hardship arguments, and real-life cases, individuals can better prepare their case and potentially avoid or reduce the impact of a driving ban. It is vital to seek legal advice and representation, gather evidence, and present a strong case in court to ensure the best possible outcome.

I WAS CAUGHT SPEEDING BY A SPEED CAMERA - WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
THE 14-DAY WINDOW
When you have been caught speeding, the police have a 14-day window within which they are obligated to send a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) to the registered keeper of the vehicle. This 14-day timeframe is not arbitrary; it's a legal requirement designed to ensure that the alleged offence is fresh in the mind of the registered keeper/driver, thereby enabling a more accurate recall of events.

WHAT CONSTITUTES THE 14-DAY PERIOD?
The 14-day period starts from the day following the alleged speeding offence. It's worth noting that the NIP must reach the registered keeper within these 14 days. If it arrives even a day later, and you can prove this, you may have grounds to contest the notice albeit rare. 

LEASED OR COMPANY CARS
If you're driving a leased or company car, the situation becomes a bit more complex. You aren’t the registered keeper in this case; the leasing company or your employer is. The NIP will initially be sent to them, and they are then required to inform the police that you were the individual in possession of the car at the time of the offence. This could add a few extra weeks to the process before the NIP finally reaches you. However, the 14-day rule still applies to the initial notice sent to the registered keeper, not to when you personally receive it.

WEEKENDS AND BANK HOLIDAYS
It's also worth mentioning that the 14-day window includes weekends and bank holidays.

￼
￼
UNDERSTANDING THE NIP AND SECTION 172 NOTICE
Receiving a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) in the post can be a daunting experience, but understanding its contents and the accompanying Section 172 notice is crucial for navigating the legal maze that follows a speeding offence.

WHAT'S IN THE NIP?
The NIP is a formal document that outlines the specifics of the alleged offence. It will include details such as the location of the incident, the speed you were allegedly travelling, and the speed limit for that particular area. This notice serves as the official record of the offence and initiates the legal process. It's not merely a warning or a slap on the wrist; it's a document that requires your immediate attention and action.

TIMEFRAMES AND CONDITIONS
The NIP will also specify any conditions and timeframes you must adhere to. For instance, you may be required to respond within a certain number of days. Failure to meet these conditions could result in further legal complications, including additional charges or penalties. Therefore, it's essential to read the NIP carefully and comply with any stipulated requirements.

THE SECTION 172 NOTICE
Accompanying the NIP is usually a Section 172 notice. This form is a legal requirement that asks you to confirm who was driving the vehicle at the time of the alleged offence. You have 28 days to complete this form and return it to the issuing authority. Failure to do so can result in a separate charge, which could carry a fine and additional penalty points.

THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCURACY
When filling out the Section 172 notice, accuracy is paramount. Providing false information is a serious offence that could lead to prosecution for perverting the course of justice and a potential disqualification from driving. Whether it was you behind the wheel or another individual, you must declare it accurately and honestly.

SHARED OR MULTI-DRIVER VEHICLES
In cases where multiple people have access to the vehicle, such as family cars or company fleets, identifying the driver might be challenging. However, the onus is still on you to find out who was driving at the time of the offence. Failure to do so could be seen as non-compliance with the Section 172 notice, leading to further legal repercussions.

FIXED PENALTY NOTICE (FPN) OR COURT?
Assuming you've confirmed that you were the driver at the time of the offence, the next step is usually receiving a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN). An FPN is generally issued for minor to moderate speeding offences and serves as an alternative to being prosecuted in court. 

The FPN will outline your options: you can either accept the FPN, pay the fine and accept the penalty points, or you reject and proceed to Court. If you opt for the latter, your case will most likely proceed to a court hearing. It's worth noting that if you were driving significantly over the speed limit, you might bypass the FPN stage altogether and find yourself facing a court summons. In such cases, seeking legal advice is strongly recommended.

THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS
The financial penalty for a speeding offence can vary considerably. At a minimum, you're looking at a £100 fine and three points on your licence. However, changes to the law in April 2017, with further updates in 2021, have complicated matters. Fines are now graded according to both the level of speeding and your weekly salary when cases proceed to Court. Speeding penalties fall into three bands:

Band A: for minor excesses, like driving up to 40mph in a 30mph zone, you'll be fined 50% of your weekly salary and receive three penalty points.
Band B: for moderate excesses, such as driving up to 50mph in a 30mph zone, the fine jumps to 150% of your weekly salary. You'll also receive between four and six penalty points or face disqualification for up to 28 days.
Band C: for major excesses, like driving over and above 50mph in a 30mph zone, the fine remains at 150% of your weekly salary, but you'll receive six penalty points or face disqualification for up to 56 days.
These fines can also be adjusted by up to 25% based on circumstances. For instance, speeding near a school could increase your fine, while doing so on a deserted road might offer some leniency.

POINTS: THE IMPACT ON YOUR LICENCE
In addition to the financial penalty, there's the matter of penalty points on your driving licence. Depending on the severity of your speeding offence, you could receive between three and six penalty points. These points remain valid for three years from the date of the offence.While you can apply for the endorsement to be removed after four years, the presence of these points can affect various aspects of your life, from job opportunities requiring a clean driving record to your ability to rent a car.


HOW LONG DOES A SPEEDING TICKET TAKE TO COME?
THE TIMELINE OF A SPEEDING TICKET
You should expect to receive your speeding ticket within 14 days of the offence if you are the registered keeper of the vehicle. This 14-day window starts from the day you were caught speeding, and the postmark on the letter should fall within this period
Upon receiving the speeding ticket, you'll find it's not just a simple fine. The ticket comes with a set of paperwork that you'll need to sort out quickly. The first document is the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP/Section 172 notice, which serves as a formal warning that you may be prosecuted for the offencewhich requires you to confirm the details of the driver at the time of the incident. This is a crucial step as failing to return this notice within 28 days could lead to further charges.
It's a process that demands your attention and timely action.

LEGAL CONSEQUENCES
Once you've returned the Section 172 notice, you'll receive a Fixed Penalty Notice. The minimal penalty for speeding in the UK is a £100 fine, along with three penalty points added to your driving licence. It's a straightforward process if your offence is minor, but it's essential to understand that the penalties can escalate.
Ignoring the Section 172 notice is not an option. Failure to return it within the stipulated 28 days could result in you being summoned to court for additional charge of failing to give information

SPEED AWARENESS COURSES
There might be another option for you: a speed awareness course. This alternative is not universally available, but in some circumstances, you could be eligible to take this course instead of receiving the standard penalties.
A speed awareness course is essentially a workshop that lasts for a day. The aim is to educate drivers about the dangers of speeding and to offer various tips on safer driving. The course covers everything from understanding speed limits to the impact of speeding on road safety and accident rates. It's an educational approach designed to make you think twice before putting your foot down on the accelerator.
However, it's important to note that not all cases qualify for a speed awareness course. Eligibility often depends on the police force’s discretion, the severity of the speeding offence and whether you've taken a similar course in the past. Additionally, while the course may save you from a fine and penalty points, it's not free. You'll still have to pay the cost of attending, which can vary but is usually around the same price as the standard fine.
Attending a speed awareness course can be a valuable alternative to traditional penalties, offering education over punishment. But it's not a get-out-of-jail-free card; it comes with its own costs and criteria.

HOW TO KNOW YOU'VE BEEN CAUGHT SPEEDING
The only definitive way to know if you have been caught speeding (when yo uare not stopped at the roadside) is by receiving the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) and Section 172 notice in the post. If 14 days pass without any postal notification, you mightwant to check the ownership of the car and where and who it is registered too, before assuming you are in the clear. 
One common misconception is that speed cameras always flash when they catch you. While some do, others rely on infrared technology to capture your speed, making them less conspicuous. Additionally, average speed cameras don't work on a single flash; they monitor your speed over a length of road.


HOW TO FIGHT A CHARGE OF CARELESS DRIVING
It is often possible to fight a charge of careless driving to reduce or completely eliminate any penalties associated with it. However, the chances of successfully challenging a careless driving prosecution will depend on the severity of the offence and the circumstances leading up to it. This can make careless driving disputes complex and difficult due to the fact that careless driving encompasses a wide range of offences, from speeding or overtaking illegally to directly putting peoples’ lives at risk.
WHAT IS CARELESS DRIVING?
Careless driving is an umbrella term that covers any actions that may have been taken without care to follow the law, and that may endanger the lives of others on the road. This could be momentarily taking your eyes off the road, undertaking vehicles or exceeding the speed limit and driving erratically.

WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES FOR CARELESS DRIVING?
The penalties for careless driving vary depending on the severity and circumstances of the offence. For example, a minor offence with minimal risk may incur a £200 fine and three penalty points, while a serious offence may incur an unlimited fine. In addition, three to nine penalty points and/or a disqualification. Depending on the circumstances of the offence, drivers could even be sentenced to prison where a death or serious injury has occurred.
In some cases, the court may offer the driver a reduction in their penalties if they agree to take an educational course. We often recommend that drivers take this option if given the opportunity, and they are at fault. However, if drivers fail to attend any of the sessions, their original penalties may be reconsidered by the court.

IS IT WORTH CHALLENGING MY CARELESS DRIVING OFFENCE?
In some cases, it might be easier to pay your fine rather than dispute it. We often recommend this route to first-time offenders due to the complexity of motoring offence disputes, and the risks that they bring; an unsuccessful dispute could lead to more severe penalties, including an unlimited fine.
If your prosecution will lead to a more serious penalty, however, it may be in your best interests to dispute the offence. You may want to do this if you can not afford to pay the fine, need to drive for your work or believe you have solid evidence that will help you to reduce or eliminate your charges. We will help you to assess whether it will be worth challenging your careless driving offence.

HOW TO DISPUTE A CARELESS DRIVING OFFENCE
The first thing you should do is contact a professional solicitor. The team at JMW will be able to advise you on what your next steps should be. It is essential that you do this as soon as possible to allow for the most amount of time to make decisions and receive advice.
You may be notified about your offence in one of two ways:

Through a fixed penalty notice
Through court summons
If you have received a fixed penalty notice, you may have been given it by a police officer or have it posted through the mail. From the time that your notice is delivered - not from when you read it, you will have to respond to police or court. Before doing so, consult a solicitor. To respond, you must fill out the correct side of the notice, detailing whether you accept your charges or intent to dispute them.
If you receive a court summons, they will detail a date on which you will be expected to attend a court hearing. If you fail to make this date, your penalty will be more severe. One of our solicitors will attend your court summons with you and will help you to prepare for your hearing leading up to it.
To prepare to defend against a careless driving offence, we will need to gather evidence to support your case. Firstly, we will access the information that the police have on your offence. This will help us to understand your chances of success and how we can counter the claims.
Evidence that we will gather to support your defence may include video footage, photos, witness statements or information specific to your reasons for driving carelessly. For example, if you drove carelessly due to a medical emergency, we will obtain evidence that supports this, such as medical reports or communications from those involved.

HOW DO SPEED CAMERAS, SPEEDING TICKETS AND SPEEDING FINES WORK?
Speed cameras are playing a growing role in traffic enforcement in the UK. By capitalising on the advantages of automation, police forces have been able to free up resources and ensure drivers move at safe speeds in high risk areas. However, there is also concern about how effective these devices really are, and whether or not we should trust an automated system with a responsibility as serious as road safety.
HOW DO SPEED CAMERAS WORK?
There are three types of speed cameras primarily used in the UK. Each uses different technology and is used for a specific purpose, so it is important to understand how they work and where you might see them used.

MOBILE SPEED CAMERAS
A mobile speed camera is operated by a police officer, usually from inside a police car. Most mobile speed cameras in the UK work by firing a very fine laser at a vehicle, which is able to detect the speed at which the vehicle is moving.
Often, the police will park in areas where the vehicle cannot be seen by passing traffic, and where there is a high risk of drivers committing speeding offences. However, the technology that powers these cameras can even work when a police vehicle is in motion, and has a range of up to one mile. If you are speeding, it can be difficult to slow down in time or to know whether or not you have been caught, unless the police pull you over.

FIXED SPEED CAMERAS
Fixed speed cameras take two photographs of your vehicle in quick succession, and by measuring the difference in position along with the time between the two images, they calculate the speed at which the vehicle was moving. For many years, this was the most common type of speed camera on British roads.
While these cameras now capture images digitally, rather than on film, they still typically use flash photography to ensure they are able to capture clear images at all times of day or night. You may recognise that you have been caught by a fixed speed camera if you see this flash.
This type of camera is often used as a deterrent - they are placed at accident hotspots and their bright yellow appearance makes them very visible, meaning that drivers who see them are encouraged to keep to the speed limit. However, in research by the RAC, 83% of the British public agreed that drivers only slow down when they drive past the camera, and then speed up again. For this reason, there is debate over whether or not this type of device is effective.

AVERAGE SPEED CAMERAS
Average speed cameras are placed at intervals and are connected together in a network of two or more. They use infrared camera technology to read licence plate information, which provides high-resolution results even at night or in poor weather conditions. Because the cameras are placed at set distances apart and operate as part of a network, they can calculate the average speed at which a vehicle travels between them each time the same licence plate is registered.
These cameras are often used in areas of motorways with variable speed limits, but they may also be placed at the beginning and end of a road with a lower speed limit than those around it. This ensures that drivers cannot simply slow down when they pass the camera - they must drive at or below the speed limit along the entire stretch of road to avoid incurring a penalty.

HOW DO SPEEDING TICKETS WORK?
If you are caught speeding or registered by a speed camera in the UK, the police must send you a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) in the post within 14 days of the alleged offence to the registered keeper. This does not necessarily mean that the police intend to prosecute, but it enables them to do so if they decide to.
The NIP is sent to the address at which the vehicle is registered, meaning that the driver who allegedly committed the offence will not necessarily receive the NIP. At this stage, the vehicle’s registered owner must identify who was driving at the time of the offence by returning the accompanying Section 172 notice within 28 days. If you do not know who was driving, you must endeavour to find out - otherwise, you can be charged with failing to provide information, which can result in a fine of up to £1,000 and six penalty points on your driving licence.
If the police proceed with their prosecution and have identified you as the driver of the vehicle, you may receive a Fixed Penalty Notice or a court summons. A Fixed Penalty Notice is usually what is meant in the UK by the phrase “speeding ticket”. The minimum penalty for speeding is a £100 fine and three penalty points on your licence - although, for your first offence, you may be given the option to attend a speed awareness course and avoid the penalty points.
If you receive points on your licence as a result of a Fixed Penalty Notice, you may incur serious consequences - for example, if you only passed your driving test within the last two years or you have accumulated six penalty points on your driving licence, this would result in you having to redo your theory and practical test.
If the police pull you over for speeding, they can issue a Fixed Penalty Notice on the spot, in which case you will not receive a NIP in the post. They may also give you a verbal warning for your first offence.
If you are summoned to court, this usually indicates that you are suspected of committing a more serious offence. You will also need to attend a court hearing if you plead not guilty when you receive your Fixed Penalty Notice. You should contact a lawyer in such cases, as representation in court is vital to your defence. If you are charged with failing to provide information, or falsely accused of speeding, you can also speak to a solicitor about your options. There is often the possibility of challenging this type of prosecution, preserving your driving licence and avoiding the most serious outcomes.

HOW DO SPEEDING FINES WORK?
As we have said above, the minimum speeding fine is £100, along with penalty points on your licence. If this is your first offence, you will usually receive a Fixed Penalty Notice along these lines; however, for more serious offences - or if you plead not guilty - you may need to attend a court hearing. If you plead not guilty but are found guilty in court, you can receive a fine of up to £1,000, or up to £2,500 if you were driving on a motorway.
These fines are based on the speed limit, the speed at which you were driving, and your income.
The National Police Chiefs' Council recommends that drivers be given leeway of 10% of the speed limit plus two mph. However, this recommendation is not binding, and it is up to the discretion of the relevant authority as to whether or not to prosecute you. Exceeding the speed limit by even one mph is enough to have broken the law and be prosecuted.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU ARE CAUGHT?
If you are caught speeding or accused of committing a speeding offence, speak to an expert motoring solicitor for advice. Losing your driving licence can be a serious inconvenience and affect your work, home and social lives, but in some cases it can be avoided.
It is always best to avoid speeding by following the speed limit at all times. Keep an eye out for any signs that indicate a change in the limit or that warn you to slow down, especially in unfamiliar areas, and make sure to plan plenty of time for your journey so that you are not tempted to speed up.

HOW MANY POINTS FOR DRIVING WITHOUT INSURANCE?
If you are caught driving without insurance, you could recieve between six and eight points on your licence, along with an unlimited fine. Every driver must have insurance before they can legally drive a motor vehicle on the road. Additionally, if you are allowing someone to drive an uninsured vehicle, you may be charged with the offence.
Read on to learn more about the guidelines and rules around driving with insurance.

WHY DO I NEED VEHICLE INSURANCE?
Every driver is expected to insure their vehicle to ensure that, if they are involved in an accident, they will be able to resolve the financial implications. The UK government reported that over 23,000 people were seriously injured, and over 95,000 were slightly injured in motoring accidents in 2021. This makes motoring accidents the largest cause of injury in the UK, and this is without taking into consideration the accidents that did not leave anyone injured, but in which cars were still damaged.
Car accidents can be very expensive. Those at fault will be required to pay for any damages caused to the other party’s vehicle, which will be done through their insurance. On top of being illegal, paying for damage to another vehicle due to an accident without insurance would be very costly. While vehicle insurance might seem expensive initially, it does help drivers out in the case of an accident.

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET CAUGHT DRIVING WITHOUT INSURANCE?
With modern camera technology, the authorities can recognise if your vehicle is not insured. You may be pulled over by the police while you are driving, or receive a visit or notification through the post.
If you are pulled over by the police and you are not insured, a number of things will happen. You will first be asked to present documentation, including your licence and information about your insurance. If you can not do this at the time you are stopped, you will have seven days to do so. However, be aware that you may be stopped again if you continue to drive during this period, and this may affect your chances of disputing the penalty and its severity.
If you believe you do have insurance but have been challenged, there may be an issue with your policy:
If it has been changed and your insurance company has not taken steps to notify you, you may have grounds to make a defence
If it has been due a renewal and you have not done so, you may be able to make a ‘special reasons’ plea. However, this may be much more difficult to prove
Driving a vehicle that you are not insured to drive will result in a minimum fixed penalty fine of £300 and six points on your licence.
The police may also seize the vehicle or destroy it in extreme circumstances. Being prosecuted for a driving offence may result in insurance companies charging you more for vehicle insurance in the future, and you may have to deal with a separate prosecution for an accident or any injuries caused.

WHAT MUST I BE INSURED FOR?
The most basic form of vehicle insurance is third-party insurance, which covers car repairs and the basic legal requirements for being able to drive. You may also be able to get a fire and theft inclusive plan. Comprehensive car insurance is the next step up from this and is more expensive, offering different benefits depending on what your provider offers. Either of these insurance policies will allow you to drive your vehicle.
Some comprehensive car insurance plans offer driving other cars (DOC) cover which will allow you to to drive other similar cars. Do not assume that your comprehensive insurance allows for this - check before you drive another vehicle for which you are not insured. The owner of the other vehicle will also be prosecuted if they allow you to drive their vehicle without the right insurance.
DOC cover also applies to vehicles that you are test driving. If you do this without the correct insurance, you will be prosecuted if caught. Some car dealerships or sellers may have a policy already in place for this, but you should check before doing anything. There are temporary insurance options for this if you do not want to spend more money on a comprehensive plan. These temporary options can sometimes be applied to short trips, too.
If you are planning to drive other types of road vehicle, such as vans, trucks or lorries, you will be required to get insurance specific to these. This is because these vehicles can be more dangerous than regular cars in different ways.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN PROSECUTED FOR DRIVING WITHOUT INSURANCE?
Sometimes, it is best to simply pay your fine and accept your points. Disputing driving claims can be difficult when the police have a lot of solid evidence against you. Additionally, if you dispute the prosecution and fail, your penalty could be increased.

SPECIAL REASONS AND THE LAW
In some driving offence cases, there may be exceptional circumstances that led to you committing a motoring offence, including drink driving, driving in an emergency or driving without insurance. These are called ‘special reasons’ and may result in a lighter penalty, or no form of punishment at all from the courts.

WHAT IS A 'SPECIAL REASON'?
‘Special reasons’ can be relied upon in most cases: drink driving, no insurance and driving whilst unfit to name a few.
There are four minimum criteria that must be met in order for the court to accept that there are ‘special reasons’ for you committing the offence. A matter must:

Be a mitigating or extenuating circumstance
Not amount to, in law, a defence to the charge
Be directly connected with the commission of the offence
Be one which the court ought properly to take into consideration when imposing sentence
Below are some common examples of what usually constitutes as a ‘special reason’:

TYPICAL FORMS OF PUNISHMENT
For the majority of motoring offences, the penalty is either a mandatory disqualification or the obligatory endorsement of penalty points. For some people, the endorsement of penalty points on their driving licence is not particularly life changing. However, a driving ban is more likely to have a significant impact on a person’s life, possibly resulting in a loss of employment.
In some instances, the court will take into account a person’s personal circumstances when deciding on the length of the disqualification that will be imposed. However, mitigating circumstances of a personal nature will not prevent the imposition of a mandatory disqualification, nor will it reduce the length of the ban below any minimum period that must be imposed.
However, as with all rules there is an exception. If you are found guilty of an offence or plead guilty, there may be ‘special reasons’ as to why you committed the offence. The court accepts that ‘special reasons’ exist, and if your situation is acknowledged, you could receive penalty points rather than a mandatory disqualification, or no points at all if your case is one involving the obligatory endorsement of points.

DRINK DRIVING
Spiked drinks
Where your drinks had been spiked and you were unaware of your true alcohol consumption.

Shortness of Distance
The distance you drove whilst you were over the limit was only a very short distance. The paramount concern of the court in this situation would be the safety of other road users and pedestrians and the likelihood of you coming into contact with members of the public. There are also a number of other factors the court will take into account, including:

How far the vehicle was driven
The manner in which the vehicle was driven
The state of the vehicle
Whether the driver had the intention to drive any further
The road, traffic and weather conditions at the time
What was the reason for the vehicle being driven
EMERGENCY
Special reasons may apply if you have driven your vehicle as a result of an emergency, such as a friend or relative requiring immediate medical attention. However, the argument is unlikely to be successful if calling an ambulance was a viable alternative.

INSURANCE
Where you have been genuinely misled into believing you were insured to drive a vehicle. An example of this would be when a parent takes out a policy of insurance on behalf of their child and forgets to renew the policy.  However, in the absence of being misled, this does not amount to a ‘special reason’.

UNFIT TO DRIVE CHARGES: THE DEFENCES
AVOIDING DISQUALIFICATION IF ACCUSED OF BEING UNFIT TO DRIVE
Anyone who is in charge of a vehicle while unfit to drive through excess alcohol or drugs and found guilty can face a penalty of ten points, with the possibility of disqualification, fines and even a prison term depending on the seriousness of the offence.
However, avoiding disqualification is a possibility in many cases depending on the situation because there is no legal definition of ‘being in charge'. Generally, an owner can be described as in charge if he or she is in possession of, or has recently driven, the vehicle.
In a number of drink-driving cases, defendants have found to be not ‘in charge' if they are passengers of their own vehicle and can prove not to have been driving, or at a distance from, it.
Attempting to enter the car, having its keys or being near enough to the car for any police officer to make a presumption of driving are all circumstances which could be tested in court but each case depends on particular circumstances.
There are other areas of the drink driving law, which are open to interpretation such as someone who is unfit to drive sitting in their car smoking a cigarette without it being driven or being asleep in it without the ignition keys.
A drink-driving case defendant who is driven by someone holding only a provisional licence will be deemed to be in charge and liable to prosecution because of the legal need to supervise the learner.
If there are any issues in this article that concern you then more detailed and specific advice relevant to your particular situation can be given through our fixed fee advice scheme. We will consider all the relevant documentation provided to us and can then advise you over the phone.
Unlike other organisations, you will be able to speak to an experienced lawyer who has actually represented defendants in Road Traffic Offence cases in court. That person will be either a senior solicitor or a Partner in this firm. The advice will then be confirmed in writing. You can, of course, choose to instruct us to represent you in relation to your case and we are able to cover road traffic cases on a national basis.

IS DANGEROUS DRIVING A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?
WHAT IS DANGEROUS DRIVING?
Dangerous driving is a broad but self-explanatory offence. It encompasses any driving that may endanger the life of the driver or others. This includes speeding, illegally overtaking, ignoring traffic lights, using a phone while driving, and so on. Dangerous driving offences are different to careless driving offences, which are designated as 'driving below a lower-than-expected level of driving standards. Dangerous driving is when the driving falls far below the level of driving standards.
A competent and careful driver will have a good understanding of the Highway Code and its up-to-date rules, understanding rules such as which vehicles they should give way to and when, how to communicate with other drivers or passengers, and other specific, situational conditions.
A driver can also be prosecuted for dangerous driving if their vehicle has a fault that they know about. By law, it is essential that, if you believe something is wrong with your vehicle, you have it inspected by a professional mechanic and repaired or replaced. Failing to do this may lead to incurring legal penalties and harming yourself or someone else.
Additionally, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs can be considered dangerous driving. Drug and drink driving are both serious offences that will go on your criminal record and driving licence, so any further motoring offences will be treated with the understanding that you are a repeat offender, resulting in higher penalties. Being under the influence while committing a dangerous driving offence will also incur a drink or drug driving offence on top of the first one.
To understand drink driving and drug driving substance limits, visit the relevant pages on our website.

WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES FOR DANGEROUS DRIVING?
Depending on the nature of the offence and how severe the consequences were, the dangerous driving charge will vary in severity. The factors that the court will consider include:
The risks associated with the manner of your driving
The effect of any alcohol or drug you consumed
The speed of your vehicle
Your behaviour
Whether any victims were pedestrians or cyclists
At the highest level, you will receive a criminal conviction with an unlimited fine, up to two years in prison and a driving disqualification. This penalty increases depending on the type of offence, with the most severe being causing death by dangerous driving, which has a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine, 14 years in prison and a minimum disqualification of two years.

WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I AM BEING PROSECUTED WITH A DANGEROUS DRIVING CHARGE?
As stated above, dangerous driving is a serious motoring offence and comes with some severe penalties. After committing such an offence, you will either be apprehended by the police or receive a notice of intended prosecution at the address the vehicle may be registered.You can choose to accept your charges and pay any fines, or dispute the allegation. This second option should not be undertaken without the help of an expert motoring offence solicitor.

TAXI TOUTING/PLYING FOR HIRE
If you have been accused of a taxi touting offence, otherwise known as plying for hire, the expert solicitors at JMW are here to assist with your defence and to help you avoid a conviction. The consequences of being found guilty for touting or soliciting can often be severe, and could impact your livelihood. However, our team is highly experienced in this often complex area of law and can help you secure the outcome you are after.
PENALTIES
If you have been accused of plying for hire or touting, not only will you face a possible Level 4 fine of anything up to £2,500, you may also face prosecution for driving without insurance because touting can invalidate your existing motor insurance policy. The offence of driving without insurance carries a penalty of between six and eight points on your licence. The court could also disqualify you from driving for any period it deems appropriate.
If you have been charged with a touting offence, the court will consider the circumstances and interpret the facts in order to determine whether your actions amount to touting/soliciting or plying for hire.

FAILURE TO PROVIDE DRIVER DETAILS OR TO STOP AFTER AN ACCIDENT
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU FAIL TO STOP AT AN ACCIDENT?
Drivers who have been involved in a road accident that has caused damage or personal injury have a legal duty to stop at the scene for long enough for anyone involved to exchange details. They must then provide certain information to the injured party or the owner of the damaged property.
The information that must be provided is:
Full name and address of the driver
Full name and address of the owner of the vehicle (if different to the driver)
Vehicle identification/registration number
It is not a legal requirement in every scenario to provide your insurance details, but it is advisable to do so. You must provide your insurance certificate if personal injury has been caused to another person and you’ve been asked for it by the police or anyone involved in the accident.

FAILURE TO REPORT A ROAD ACCIDENT EXPLAINED
If drivers fail to stop and provide information, they have a legal obligation to report the accident to the police as soon as is reasonably possible within 24 hours. Otherwise, drivers may be charged with a failure to report an accident offence - also known as failure to provide driver details, or a failure to furnish information penalty.
If you receive an official police request for driver information, do not ignore it, even if you were not involved in the accident. Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, all drivers are required to provide the police with information about their vehicle and the circumstances of an accident they were involved in or witnessed. Failure to do so is a criminal offence and carries significant penalties.

WHAT IS THE PENALTY FOR FAILING TO STOP AFTER AN ACCIDENT, OR FOR FAILING TO REPORT AN ACCIDENT?
If it’s believed the driver failed to stop and failed to report the accident, they can be charged with both or either of the offences. This may be done through a notice of intended prosecution (NIP). Information about the nature of the offence, when and where it took place, and the penalties the driver is facing will be included within.
The penalties for both offences are potentially very serious. In line with the failure to stop or failure to provide driver details S172 sentencing guidelines, they could include:
Up to six months' imprisonment
Disqualification from driving or five to 10 penalty points on your licence
Unlimited fine

WHAT INFORMATION AM I REQUIRED TO PROVIDE IF I AM INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT?
If you are involved in a car accident, you are typically required to stop at the scene and provide the following information:
Your name and address: you must provide your name and address to anyone involved in the accident if there is damage or injury. If you are not the vehicle's owner, you must also provide the owner's name and address.
Vehicle registration number: you should provide the registration number of the vehicle you were driving.
Insurance details: while you might not have to provide insurance details at the scene, you should provide them to the police if asked within a reasonable time frame.
WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I PANIC AND LEAVE THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT UNINTENTIONALLY?
Leaving the scene of an accident without stopping and providing the required information is a serious offence. If you panic and leave the scene unintentionally, here are some steps you should consider taking:
Return to the scene if it is safe: if you realise your mistake quickly and it is safe to do so, consider returning to the scene of the accident
Report the accident to the police: if you cannot return to the scene, you should report the accident to the police within 24 hours, but the sooner the better. Explain the situation honestly, including your reasons for leaving the scene
Contact your insurance company: notify your insurance company of the accident, providing them with all relevant details
Seek legal advice: given the serious nature of leaving the scene of an accident, it might be advisable to seek legal advice, especially if there were injuries or significant damages involved. A legal professional can guide you through the legal process and help you understand your rights and obligations

IS FAILING TO PROVIDE A SPECIMEN A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?
Failing to provide a specimen is seen by the courts as a serious criminal offence. Often linked with drink driving convictions, this can make specimen failure lead to some harsh penalties.
The law regarding failing to provide a specimen - of breath after being stopped by police at the roadside, or breath, blood or urine later on at the police station - means that a driver can be accused of the offence if they refuse a police officer's request to do so without a reasonable excuse.
If you’ve been accused of failing to provide a specimen, our experts will be able to assist you in contesting the charges.

CAN YOU GET AWAY WITH FAILING TO PROVIDE A SPECIMEN?
If the police officers that pull you over ask you to provide a specimen, you must do so by law. If you are found guilty of trying to avoid doing so without an acceptable reason, you may face fines, disqualification from driving, and even imprisonment in more serious cases. An expert solicitor can help you to understand whether you have a valid reason for avoiding a test and may be able to help you reduce or even remove your sentence.

WHAT ARE CONSIDERED REASONABLE EXCUSES FOR NOT PROVIDING A SPECIMEN?
There are a number of reasons that constitute a reasonable excuse in the eyes of the courts and could therefore help to reduce or remove your penalty. These include:

A medical condition - a reasonable excuse could be a medical condition suffered by the driver, although this would have to be backed up with expert evidence.
A mental health condition - this may be a pre-existing condition, or one brought about by the circumstances of the situation.
Police behaviour and procedural errors - failure in the testing of equipment or following proper procedures by a police officer may also mean the case will not go to court or can be contested. Equally, after asking someone to take a test, the police must explain that failure to do so may lead to prosecution. If this warning is not given, the driver will not have committed an offence.
A phobia of needles - if a blood test is requested by police, a reasonable excuse for not complying could be a genuine phobia of needles. However, if the case is taken to court for assessment, you will need to be able to back this up with medical evidence.
WHAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED REASONABLE EXCUSES FOR NOT PROVIDING A SPECIMEN?
Meanwhile, there are a number of arguments that are not accepted by the court, including:
Belief that you were not over the limit - your personal belief that you were not over the legal alcohol or drug limit is unlikely to be considered a reasonable excuse for failing to provide a specimen.
Personal or work commitments - the inconvenience of the test or the impact it might have on personal or work commitments is unlikely to be considered a reasonable excuse.
Preference for a particular type of test - if you refuse to provide one type of specimen (e.g. breath) but offer another (e.g. blood), this is unlikely to be accepted as a reasonable excuse if the police has specific reasons for requesting a particular type of test.
Disagreement with the reason for testing - if you disagree with the police's reason for requesting the specimen, perhaps because you don't believe they had reasonable grounds to suspect you of a drink or drug driving offence, this is unlikely to be accepted as a reasonable excuse.
Before deciding to dispute your charges, you should consult with a solicitor who will help you to fully understand your potential failing to provide a specimen defences.

WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE FOR FAILING TO PROVIDE A SPECIMEN?
If you are found guilty of failing to provide a specimen, your punishment can vary depending on the circumstances. It can include an unlimited fine of £5,000 and a minimum driving ban of 12 months, although if you have been convicted of a drink driving or alcohol-related offence in the last 10 years, the minimum driving ban increases to three years.
In the most serious of cases involving a failure to provide a sample, you could be facing a prison sentence of up to six months. Given the significant penalties for an offence that may not seem all that serious at first, it is essential you seek expert legal help to make sure you are not punished unnecessarily.

WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR PLEADING NOT GUILTY TO FAILING TO PROVIDE A SPECIMEN?
If recommended by your solicitor, you may want to plead not guilty. The process of doing so typically follows this process:

Enter your plea: at your first court hearing, you will be asked to enter a plea. If you plead not guilty, the case will be scheduled for trial where you will need to explain your reasons
Pre-trial preparations: your solicitor will gather evidence, consult with any necessary experts (such as medical professionals if a medical defence is being raised) and prepare your argument
Trial: at the trial, both you and the prosecution will present evidence and arguments. You may be called to testify, and other witnesses may also be questioned, but your solicitor will be able to present your evidence on your behalf
Verdict: after considering the evidence, the magistrates or jury (depending on the court) will deliver a verdict. If you are found not guilty, your charges will be dropped. If you are found guilty, the court will proceed to sentencing
Appeal: if you believe there was a legal error in your trial, you may have the right to appeal the conviction or the sentence. However, you should never do this without your solicitor's agreement, so seek legal advice before making any challenging decisions

CAN I BE CHARGED WITH FAILING TO PROVIDE A SPECIMEN IF I WAS NOT DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE?
You can be charged with failing to provide a specimen even if you were not driving under the influence. The offence relates to failing to comply with the request for a specimen, not the underlying reason for the request. If the police have reasonable grounds to suspect that you have been driving or attempting to drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs, they may request a specimen.

CAN I NEGOTIATE WITH THE PROSECUTION TO REDUCE THE CHARGES OR PENALTIES?
Your solicitor may be able to arrange a plea bargain by arguing your case. However, this is not common practice in the UK regarding specimen offences.
In some cases where mitigating circumstances are relevant, the court may offer to reduce a sentence, but this will depend on factors like the strength of the evidence and the specific facts of the case.
You should consult with a legal professional to understand whether this is a possibility before making any decisions.

TOTTING UP OFFENCES EXPLAINED
‘Totting up’ refers to a driver accumulating 12 or more penalty points on their licence within a period of three years. At this point, a court has to arrange a hearing where they will consider imposing a disqualification from driving for a minimum period of six months.
If you have previously been disqualified from driving for a period of 56 days or more within the relevant three-year period, this would increase the ban from six months to 12 months. If you have previously been disqualified from driving for a period of 56 days or more, on two occasions or more within the relevant three-year period, the disqualification for totting up would be increased to two years.
The court hearing offers defendants and lawyers a chance to rely upon what is known as an 'exceptional hardship' argument to convince the court to exercise its discretion and refrain from imposing a disqualification.

EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP AND TOTTING UP DEFENCE
Exceptional hardship arguments give the accused an opportunity to prove that a ban from driving would cause more suffering for them and others than the average motorist. For some, the consequences of committing, for example, four minor speeding offences, within three years, would far outweigh the crime.
Normally, these arguments can be divided into emotional and financial hardship - if the driver cares for relatives or needs to drive for their job, for example. If your reasons for having a number of points on your licence come from these life stresses, it may be instrumental in helping you to retain your licence and, thus, your responsibilities.
This is why enlisting the help of an experienced solicitor is recommended. The right legal team can draw together the necessary documents and other evidence and provide the legal advice needed to improve your chances of achieving a strong totting up defence and positive outcome.

DRIVING BANS DUE TO TOTTING UP
Should you be banned from driving, you will not be permitted to drive any type of motor vehicle in the UK until your ban has ended. After your ban has been served, all previous penalty points will be removed and your licence will be returned to you.
A driving ban can have a significant impact on your life, especially if you rely on using your car either personally or professionally. It is therefore essential that you seek the right expert legal help to give you the best opportunity to avoid or reduce a ban.


MOBILE PHONE DRIVING OFFENCES EXPLAINED
Using a handheld mobile phone while driving is strictly prohibited and, because it is viewed as an activity that could cause danger on the road, is treated as a very serious offence. If the use of the device results in a clear danger, this could lead to a charge of dangerous driving that might even result in a custodial sentence.
However, despite the seriousness of the offence, an allegation need not always lead to a conviction and it is therefore imperative that if you find yourself in such a situation you are able to access expert legal assistance to help better defend yourself against the charge.

PENALTIES
According to road safety statistics, a person driving while using a mobile phone is four times more likely to have an accident. As a result, the government has introduced legislation that has gradually become more severe. As it now stands, the punishment for the offence is:
A fine of £200; and
Six penalty points
The legislation has also been extended to cover employers who require employees to take or make calls when driving. Other activities that are also caught by the regulations include:
Listening to voicemails
Sending or reading text messages
Sending or receiving faxes
Using the internet
If you are accused of a mobile phone driving offence, it is therefore important that you have access to the right legal help to give you the very best chance of securing the outcome you are after.

HANDHELD DEVICES
If you hold your mobile phone when either making or receiving a call while driving, the device is classified as handheld and this would represent an illegal action. It is important to remember, however, that while the use of a hands-free device does not lead to a specific ban, if its use is deemed to have negatively affected your driving then you can still be prosecuted by the police.

DIFFERENT SCENARIOS
The law surrounding the use of mobile phones while driving can be complex and there are certain scenarios in which you may or may not face police action. Some of the more common examples include:
In stationary traffic - You can be charged for using your mobile phone even if you are in stationary traffic. The only exception is if your car's engine was switched off at the time
Passengers - If you are the passenger in a car but are supervising a provisional or learner driver, you could face a charge if you were found to be using a mobile phone while instructing them
Employers - If an employer permits or encourages their employees to use their mobile phone while driving, they too can be prosecuted
The law surrounding mobile phone use when driving is not black and white, and should you be accused of committing the crime, it may be that with the right legal help you are able to build a robust defence to help you successfully fight the allegation.

HOW TO APPEAL A DRIVING CONVICTION FROM THE MAGISTRATES' COURT
If you've received a driving conviction from a Magistrates' Court, you may be feeling a mix of emotions - frustration, confusion, and perhaps even a sense of injustice. It's a challenging situation, but it's important to remember that you have legal rights and options available to you. One of these options is the right to appeal your conviction or sentence imposed if you believe it to be unfair or that you have been wrongly convicted.

UNDERSTANDING THE MAGISTRATES' COURT
The Magistrates' Court serves as the first point of contact for the vast majority of criminal cases in England and Wales, including motoring offences. These courts are presided over by magistrates, who are trained volunteers from the community, or by district judges. Unlike Crown Courts, Magistrates' Courts do not involve juries.
When it comes to motoring offences, the Magistrates' Court handles a wide range of cases, from minor infractions like speeding or using a mobile phone while driving, to more serious offences like drink-driving or dangerous driving. The penalties for these various driving offences can vary significantly depending on the severity of the offence and any previous convictions you may have. Penalties can range from fines and penalty points on your driving licence to driving disqualifications or even imprisonment in extreme cases.
It's crucial to take any driving offence or conviction seriously and to understand your rights and options for appeal.

YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL WITH THE MAGISTRATES' COURT
If you've been handed a driving conviction or sentence that you believe is unjust or unfair, it's important to know that you have the legal right to lodge an appeal. This is not a step to be taken lightly, but it is an essential part of the a review process designed to ensure fairness and justice. When you decide to appeal a decision from the Magistrates' Court, your case will be moved to the Crown Court for a fresh review.
At the Crown Court, your appeal will be heard by a judge along with two magistrates. This is a more formal setting than the Magistrates' Court. The judge and magistrates will review the evidence, hear arguments from both sides, and ultimately make a decision on whether the original conviction or sentence should be upheld, reduced or even quashed.
It's worth noting that if you were not present at the original Magistrates' Court hearing, or if you believe an error has been made, you can request the trial magistrate to re-open the case. This is a separate process from lodging an appeal but can sometimes be a quicker way to rectify any mistakes or oversights.

WHEN TO APPEAL
Timing is of the essence when it comes to lodging an appeal against a driving conviction. There is a strict 15 business days’ time limit from the date of your conviction or sentencing within which you must lodge your appeal. Missing this deadline can severely limit your options for seeking justice and the Court may not allow the appeal as you have lodged it out of time.
Given the time-sensitive nature of the appeal process, it's highly advisable to seek professional legal advice as soon as you receive your sentence or conviction. Legal professionals can provide you with tailored advice based on the specifics of your case, helping you decide whether an appeal is the right course of action for you. They can also guide you through the complex paperwork and legal procedures involved in lodging an appeal, ensuring that you meet all deadlines and requirements.
If you're considering an appeal, don't delay. The clock starts ticking as soon as you receive your sentence, and the window for action is narrow. Make sure you consult with a solicitor promptly to assess your options and begin the appeal process if it's deemed appropriate.

HOW TO LODGE AN APPEAL
If you've decided to appeal your driving conviction, the first step is to formally lodge your appeal. This is a legal process that requires attention to detail and adherence to specific procedures. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate this task:
Consult a legal advisor: before taking any action, consult a legal advisor experienced in motoring offences, such as the team at JMW. They can guide you through the appeal process and help you to prepare your case.
Obtain the necessary forms: you'll need to fill out specific forms to begin the appeal process. These forms are usually available from the Magistrates' Court where you were convicted or from their website.
Complete the forms: fill out the forms carefully, providing all the required information. Make sure to double-check for errors, as any inaccuracies can delay or jeopardise your appeal.
Submit the forms: once completed, submit the forms to the Magistrates' Court or administrative court that issued your conviction. 
Prepare for the hearing: after submitting your appeal, you'll be given a date for your hearing at the Crown Court. Use this time to prepare your case, gather evidence, and consult with your legal advisor.
Attend the hearing: on the day of the hearing, you'll present your case before a Crown Court Judge and two magistrates. Make sure to follow all court protocols and procedures
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
While the right to appeal is a fundamental aspect of the British legal system, there are special circumstances that can affect your ability to appeal:
High Court appeals: in some rare cases, you may be able to appeal directly to the High Court if you believe the Magistrates' Court made an error in law during your conviction or sentencing. This is a complex and unusual route, so consult a legal advisor if you believe this applies to you.
Pleading guilty: if you pleaded guilty in the Magistrates' Court, you generally have the right to appeal only against your sentence, not your conviction. 
Pleading not guilty: if you pleaded not guilty in the Magistrates' Court, you have the right to appeal against both your conviction and your sentence. This gives you more flexibility in presenting your case at the Crown Court.
Reopening the case: if you were not present during your original hearing or believe an error was made, you can request the Magistrates' Court to reopen your case. This is different from an appeal and may be a quicker way to rectify any issues.

In the United Kingdom, driving offenses are categorized into three bands for fines: A, B, and C. These bands determine the severity of the offense and the corresponding penalty. Let’s break it down:

Band A Fine: This applies to minor speeding offenses, where your speed is just 1 to 10 mph over the speed limit. The fine typically amounts to around 50% of your weekly income12.
Band B Fine: If you were driving 11 to 20 mph over the speed limit, you fall into this category. The fine can be approximately 100% of your weekly income12.
Band C Fine: For more significant violations, such as driving more than 21 mph over the speed limit, the penalty falls under this band12.
Remember that the minimum penalty for speeding is a £100 fine and 3 penalty points added to your license. Accumulating 12 or more penalty points within a 3-year period may result in disqualification from drivin


How much is a speeding fine?
Legal speed limit (mph)	Recorded speed (mph)	Recorded speed (mph)	Recorded speed (mph)
Band A	Band B	Band C
20	21-30	31-40	41 and above
30	31-40	41-50	51 and above
40	41-55	56-65	66 and above
50	51-65	66-75	76 and above
60	61-80	81-90	91 and above
70	71-90	91-100	101 and above
Points/ disqualification	3 points	Disqualify 7-28 days OR 4-6 points	Disqualify 7-56 days OR 6 points
Fine	50% of relevant weekly income*	100% of relevant weekly income*	150% of relevant weekly income*
*This is what you can expect but the magistrate can fine you anywhere within a range of 25% on either side of that figure, meaning serious offenders could face a fine of 175% their weekly income.
This fine, however, is capped at £1,000, rising to £2,500 if you are caught on a motorway.
The speeding fines are calculated as a percentage of weekly income after tax and National Insurance deductions are applied.
For lower income offenders or those on state benefit (such as Universal Credit) the Sentencing Council bases the speeding fine calculation on "an amount that is deemed to represent the offender’s relevant weekly income" currently this is calculated as a weekly income of £120.
For unemployed offenders, the speeding fine calculation will depend on a range of factors including current financial circumstances, amount of outgoings, earning potential, and savings.

How much is a speeding fine for doing 40 in a 30?
If you are caught driving 40mph in a 30mph zone then you will be prosecuted under the Band A rules, which means three penalty points will be added to your licence. You will also incur a fine, calculated against your weekly income.
For example. Based on an annual income of £30,000:
If you’re caught driving 40mph in a 30mph zone (10mph over the speed limit) you could receive a fine of £288 (50% of your weekly wage) and 3 points on your licence
If you’re caught driving 45mph in a 30mph zone (15mph over the speed limit) you could receive a fine of £577 (100% of your weekly wage) and 4 - 6 points on your licence
Finally, if you’re caught driving 51mph in a 30mph zone (21mph over the speed limit) you could receive a fine of £865 (150% of your weekly wage) and 6 points on your licence

Am I allowed a 10% leeway of the speed limit?
In the eyes of the law, you’re liable for a speeding fine as soon as you exceed the limit. So if you’re doing 31mph in a 30 limit or 71mph on a motorway, you’re breaking the law.
Guidance from the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) does recommend giving drivers a so-called ‘10% plus 2’ leeway, to aid police officers in using 'discretion', however, it is well worth remembering this is only a recommendation, not the law.
Most speed cameras have to be manually set to trigger at a speed, however, it is unconfirmed whether they are in fact set 10% above the limit. It's not worth gambling and assuming they give you 10% - never exceed the speed limit.
When you are caught speeding by a mobile camera, it is up to the police officer's discretion to penalise you if you are over the speed limit in any way, they can choose to take the NPCC's guidance, but do not have to, because - as stated above - 1 mile an hour over is still breaking the law. 
The best advice is to not speed full stop


Minor speeding offences
If you think you have been flashed by a speed camera, you have to wait 14 days for it to be confirmed or not: that’s how long the police have to issue a ‘notice of intended prosecution’, or NIP.
It is sent to the registered keeper of the vehicle – worth bearing in mind if you drive a company vehicle or a hire car.
For minor speeding offences, and if you're eligible, the police can offer the chance to take a speed awareness course, instead of issuing speeding fines and penalty points. You have to pay for this – and it usually takes half a day – but it does help keep your licence clean.
Whether you're eligible for an awareness course varies depending on which police force is handling your offence.

Serious speeding offences
Speed awareness courses are rarely offered for more serious speeding offences. According to the National Driver Offender Retraining Scheme, "Most police forces offer a course to drivers who are caught speeding between 10% plus 2 and 10% plus 9 of the legal limit."
Beyond that upper limit usually calls for a minimum fine of £100 and three or six penalty points on your licence.
The police give 28 days to nominate the driver and pay the penalty; points will then be issued against the driver’s licence.
If you don’t reply within 28 days, the matter can be referred to court.
Very serious speeding offences are referred to court anyway, where the penalty could be as high as £1000 – or £2500 if you were caught on a motorway.
If you collect more than 12 points in any three year period, you face disqualification from driving; you can apply to have points removed after four years.
