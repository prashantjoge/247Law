In the UK, laboratory analysis methods are employed to detect alcohol in blood samples. These tests serve various purposes, including legal proceedings and assessing an individual’s alcohol consumption. Let’s explore the different types of blood alcohol tests:

Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) Test: This is considered the gold standard for blood alcohol testing. It directly detects PEth, a biomarker associated with alcohol use. PEth testing provides accurate results and is commonly used for legal purposes12.
Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin (CDT) Test: CDT is an indirect marker of alcohol consumption. It requires at least two weeks of sustained alcohol use to elevate CDT levels above the cutoff. Typically, CDT returns to normal within four weeks after alcohol consumption ends1.
Liver Function Test (LFT): Also known as a liver blood test, this assesses liver functionality by measuring specific enzymes and proteins in the blood. Liver damage is often indicative of alcohol misuse1.
Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) Test: The MCV test provides insight into ingested alcohol. It indirectly reflects alcohol consumption based on red blood cell size1.
These blood alcohol tests can be used together to gain a comprehensive understanding of an individual’s alcohol use. For legal purposes, PEth testing is the most accurate2. If you need to order a blood alcohol test for court, consider consulting a reliable testing service13.
