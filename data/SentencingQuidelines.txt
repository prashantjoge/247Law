29 - 36 months (Extend if imposing immediate custody)

36 - 60 months

NOTE: when considering the guidance regarding the length of disqualification in the case of a second offence, the period to be imposed in any individual case will depend on an assessment of all the relevant circumstances, including the length of time since the earlier ban was imposed and the gravity of the current offence but disqualification must be for at least three years.

The court should then consider further adjustment for any aggravating or mitigating factors. The following is a non-exhaustive list of additional factual elements providing the context of the offence and factors relating to the offender. Identify whether any combination of these, or other relevant factors, should result in an upward or downward adjustment from the sentence arrived at so far.

Factors increasing seriousness of offence

Statutory aggravating factors

Previous convictions, having regard to a) the nature of the offence to which the conviction relates and its relevance to the current offence; and b) the time that has elapsed since the conviction
Offence committed while on bail
Other aggravating factors

Failure to comply with current court orders
Offence committed on licence or post sentence supervision
LGV, HGV, PSV etc.
Poor road or weather conditions
Carrying passengers
Driving for hire or reward
Evidence of unacceptable standard of driving
Involved in accident
High level of traffic or pedestrians in the vicinity
Factors reducing seriousness or reflecting personal mitigation

No previous convictions or no relevant / recent convictions
Genuine emergency established *
Spiked drinks *

Mental disorder or learning ability
Sole or primary carer for dependent relatives
* even where not amounting to special reasons

Step 3 - Consider any factors which indicate a reduction, such as assistance to the prosecution
The court should take into account sections 73 and 74 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (assistance by defendants: reduction or review of sentence) and any other rule of law by virtue of which an offender may receive a discounted sentence in consequence of assistance given (or offered) to the prosecutor or investigator.

Step 4 - Reduction for guilty pleas
The court should take account of any potential reduction for a guilty plea in accordance with section 144 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and guilty plea guidelines. SEE NOTE

Step 5 - Totality principle
If sentencing an offender for more than one offence, or where the offender is already serving a sentence, consider whether the total sentence is just and proportionate to the overall offending behaviour in accordance with the offences taken into consideration and totality guidelines.

Step 6 - Compensation and ancillary orders
In all cases, the court should consider whether to make compensation and/or other ancillary orders including offering a drink driving rehabilitation course, deprivation and/or forfeiture or suspension of personal liquor licence.

Step 7 - Reasons
Section 174 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 imposes a duty to give reasons for, and explain the effect of, the sentence.

Step 8 - Consideration for time spent on bail
The court must consider whether to give credit for time spent on bail in accordance with section 240A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

NOTE: Reduction in sentence for early guilty plea
Defendants who plead guilty can benefit from a reduction in the sentence they receive based on the stage of proceedings at which their willingness to admit guilt was indicated. The reduction will be gauged on a sliding scale as follows:

1) A guilty plea at the first reasonable opportunity should result in at least a recommended one third off any sentence imposed
2) A guilty plea after a trial date has been set should result in at least a recommended one quarter off any sentence imposed
3) A guilty plea 'at the door of the court' or after the trail has begun should result in at least a recommended one tenth off any sentence imposed

The reduction awarded for an early guilty plea applies to the punitive elements of the sentence only, it has no impact on ancillary orders including the length of any disqualification to be imposed.

DRINK DRIVING LAWS IN THE UK
Drink driving laws in the UK are strictly enforced and the penalties upon conviction can be severe. In the UK it is illegal to:

Drive or attempt to drive with excess alcohol (while exceeding the legal limit)
Be in charge of a motor vehicle with excess alcohol (while exceeding the legal limit)
Drive or attempt to drive while unfit through drink (alcohol) or drugs
Be in charge of a motor vehicle whilst unfit through drink (alcohol) or drugs
Fail to co-operate with a preliminary road side breath test when required to do so
Fail to provide an evidential specimen (blood, breath or urine) for analysis while driving or attempting to drive a vehicle
Fail to provide an evidential specimen (blood, breath or urine) for analysis while in charge of a vehicle
Fail to give permission for a laboratory test of a specimen of blood taken while that person was incapable of consenting

High Risk Offender Classification
High risk offenders are drivers who are convicted of repeated and/or serious drink driving offences.

High Risk Offenders are Drivers who:

Have been disqualified by order of a court upon conviction for either:
driving or attempting to drive with excess alcohol (DR10), or
being in charge of a vehicle with alcohol concentration exceeding the legal limit (DR40);
While being over two and a half times the legal drink driving limit with a blood alcohol concentration that equalled or exceeded:
87.5 microgrammes per 100 millilitres of breath, or
200 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood, or
267.5 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of urine; OR
Have been disqualified by order of a court for failing, without reasonable excuse, to provide a specimen for analysis when ordered to do so while either:
driving or attempting to drive (DR30), or
being in charge or a vehicle (DR60);
Have been disqualified by order of a court for failing, without reasonable excuse, to give permission for a laboratory test of a specimen of blood taken while that person was incapable of consenting to such a specimen being taken.
Have been disqualified by order of a court on two or more occasions within a period of 10 years for any of the following offences:
driving or attempting to drive with alcohol concentration exceeding the legal limit (DR10)
driving or attempting to drive while unfit through drink (DR20)
being in charge of a vehicle with alcohol concentration exceeding the legal limit (DR40)

Blood Sample Test
The appointed doctor will take a sample of blood during your medical. This will be tested for the CDT (Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin) biomarker. The CDT biomarker is reportedly more accurate with the percentage of false positives being relatively low compared to other biomarkers. In a Department of Transport Study (Road Safety Research Report No. 104, 2010), CDT test results were able to identify drinking indicative of harmful or dependent alcohol intake significantly more accurate than other biomarkers. The DVLA CDT test results will be assessed using a traffic light system of green, amber and red which will correspond to a range of %CDT cut off levels for licensing purposes.
For drivers with a history of alcohol dependence
GREEN - %CDT = 1.6% or less. A CDT level of 1.6% or less suggests no recent alcohol intake. This means that a CDT level up to and including 1.6% would be acceptable as evidence of there being no recent alcohol intake in someone classed as alcohol dependent.
RED - %CDT = 1.7% - 2.2% or more. A CDT level between 1.7% and 2.2% or more suggests recent excess alcohol intake.
For drivers with a history of alcohol misuse: A CDT level of up to 2.2% is acceptable as evidence of controlled drinking in someone with a previous history of alcohol misuse only. Otherwise the amber levels below would apply.
For drivers with no history of alcohol dependence or misuse
GREEN - %CDT = 2.2% or less. A CDT level of less than 2.2% or less is considered to be in the normal range. A person whose CDT level falls within this range is identified as consuming little or no alcohol and is compatible for licensing.
