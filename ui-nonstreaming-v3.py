# me and my girlfriend decided to go on a joyride on a scenic road in the suburb of Leeds in England.  The speed limit on the road was 20 KM and it was a  bidirectional road.  However there were some Sunday drivers in front of us who were blocking the scenic view ahead of us. We overtook a string of cars at about 40 KM's. Shortly after that we were pulled over for over speeding. We acknowledged that we were over speeding because we were just trying to overtake the other vehicles. The officer reminded that it was a no passing zone. We acknowledged and apologized. He was about to let us go when he noticed some empty beer cans on the back of the car. He wanted us to open the backdoor, but we immediately told him that we had a few beers on the way. he had me do a breath test and it showed 25.
