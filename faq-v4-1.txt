Question:  "I think I may have been caught speeding by a camera, how can I challenge this ?"

If a prosecution for speeding is brought against you, then you can challenge it on these grounds. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you. We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish"

Question:  "I may have been caught speeding by a camera, but there were no police present, am I likely to be prosecuted ?"  Answer: "For the purposes of a speeding conviction, there is no requirement for the police to be present if a camera records you driving in excess of the speed limit" 
Question:  "I may have been caught speeding by a police officer, but the officer was alone, am I likely to be prosecuted ?"  Answer: "If the police officer was using a speed camera which showed that you were driving above the speed limit then there is no requirement for an additional police officer to be present. If the officer was not using a speed camera or other recording equipment an additional police officer needs to be present to corroborate that you were driving above the speed limit before you can be prosecuted." 
Question:  "A police officer stopped me for speeding, how long do I have to wait before they prosecute me ?"  Answer: "If you have been stopped by a police officer, then they have 6 months to bring the case against you to court. It is likely that you can challenge the allegation if the police do not present your case to the court within this time. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you. We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish."

Question:  "What is a Notice of Intended Prosecution?"  Answer: "You will receive a Notice of Intended Prosecution if the police believe that your vehicle was involved in an offence and the driver was not stopped at the time. This letter should tell you the details surrounding the alleged offence, including your vehicle details, date, time and location of the alleged speeding offence as well as the legal speed limit for the road in question. The notice means that the police are considering whether to commence criminal proceedings against the driver of the vehicle." 
Question:  "I have just received a Notice of Intended Prosecution, what do I do now?"  Answer: "You need to provide the details of the driver of the vehicle within 28 days. If you do not return this information within 28 days you may commit an offence of failure to furnish information."

Question:  "I have received a Notice of Intended Prosecution but I do not know who the driver is, what should I do?"

Depending on the seriousness of the allegation you may be offered a Fixed Penalty Notice, Speed Awareness Course or the option to plead guilty by post. If you wish to challenge the allegation it is likely that you will need to defend your case in court. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you. We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish." 
Question:  "I have just received a Notice of Intended Prosecution, do I need a lawyer?"  Answer: "Not necessarily. If the Notice of Intended Prosecution alleges a more serious offence or if you have previous motoring convictions it is advisable to contact a lawyer. If you have never committed a motoring offence before, if the offence alleged in the Notice of Intended Prosecution is less serious and you do not want to challenge the facts alleged you may not need a lawyer." 
Question:  "I have just received a Notice of Intended Prosecution, what documents do I need to return?"  Answer: "Unless the Notice of Intended Prosecution requests otherwise, you do not need to send any money or your driving licence at this point. All you need to do is complete the form with your details and confirming the identity of the driver of the vehicle at the time of the alleged offence." 
Question:  "I have completed and returned the Notice of Intended Prosecution, what happens now?"  Answer: "Usually, for a minor speeding offence you will receive a Fixed Penalty Notice which offers you the opportunity to accept a fine of £60 and three penalty points on your licence. You can reject this Fixed Penalty Notice and challenge the offence in the Magistrates’ Court. If your speed was excessive (over 40% of the speed limit) you may receive a summons to attend the Magistrates’ Court." 
Question:  "To where should I return my completed Notice of Intended Prosecution form?"  Answer: "Your completed document should be returned to the local authority dealing with alleged motoring offences. The Notice of Intended Prosecution should state where to return the forms."

Answer: "If you are found guilty of a speeding offence in Court you may receive three to six penalty points on your licence, a means-tested fine between £100-£1000 (if the offence did not occur on a motorway) or up to £2500 (if the offence did occur on the motorway) and a possible disqualification." 
Question:  "I have received a Court Summons, what can I do?"  Answer: "You have three main options in response to receiving the court summons: 1. Plead not guilty. 2. Plead guilty by post and submit a plea of mitigation. 3. Plead guilty and attend the court hearing with your plea of mitigation." 
Question:  "I have received a court summons, but have not received a Notice of Intended Prosecution, is this valid?"  Answer: "If you were stopped by the police at the time of the alleged offence and told about a possible conviction then it is not necessary for you to receive a Notice of Intended Prosecution." 
Question:  "The details in my Court Summons are incorrect, is it invalid?"  Answer: "Simple mistakes such as an error in your vehicle details or personal information can be changed by the court and will not invalidate the court summons. However, if there is a large error which affects your ability to defend your case the court may dismiss your prosecution." 
Question:  "My court summons asks me to attend a court which is not in my local area. Can I change the location?"  Answer: "Not usually. Only in exceptional circumstances will the hearing take place outside of the local area where the alleged offence occurred." 
Question:  "Can I plead guilty by post?"  Answer: "Your summons will state whether or not you can plead guilty by post. If you face disqualification or the offence is more serious then you may be required to attend the court hearing." 
Question:  "What happens if I plead guilty by post?"  Answer: "If you plead guilty by post you can send a letter of mitigation to the court and they will pass a sentence upon you in your absence." 
Question:  "My letter of mitigation has been rejected, what do I do now?"  Answer: "The court may reject your letter of mitigation because they are considering disqualification or because your letter is read as a not guilty plea. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you.

Question:  "Is it better for me to attend the court in person rather than plead guilty by post?"  Answer: "It depends on the facts of your case.

We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish." 
Question:  "What is a Speed Awareness Course?"  Answer: "Sometimes a driver may be offered the chance to attend a Speed Awareness Course instead of accepting the Fixed Penalty Notice. The titles and content of these courses varies regionally. They are courses held in local centres designed to educate the driver about the dangers of speeding and to encourage the driver not to commit a motoring offence again." 
Question:  "Should I attend a Speed Awareness Course?"  Answer: "This depends upon your personal situation. If you accept a Speed Awareness Course you will not face further prosecution or receive penalty points or a fine for the alleged offence." 
Question:  "I have not been offered a Speed Awareness Course; can I request it instead of my Fixed Penalty Notice?"

Question:  "Can I pay a larger fine or receive more penalty points on my licence rather than face disqualification?"  Answer: "The court will consider your letter of mitigation when sentencing you, as well as your personal circumstances. Therefore, it is possible that the court may impose a higher fine and more penalty points instead of disqualification. However, this is not guaranteed, particularly if you face disqualification because you have obtained 12 penalty points over three years." 
Question:  "What is a plea of mitigation?"  Answer: "A plea of mitigation states all the reasons why the court should impose a lenient sentence upon you. You can make your plea of mitigation in court in person or by sending the court a letter of mitigation when pleading guilty by post. Generate your letter of mitigation here." 
Question:  "What is the difference between a totting up mandatory disqualification and a discretionary disqualification?"  Answer: "mandatory disqualification arises when you obtain 12 penalty points on your driving licence over three years. The court is required to disqualify you from driving for six months unless it would cause you exceptional hardship. When your driving licence is returned to you it will be clean of any penalty points. A discretionary disqualification will be given by the courts if you have seriously violated the speed limit and they believe it is appropriate to impose a driving ban. This driving ban can be shorter or longer than six months depending on the seriousness of the offence and the licence may be returned to you with previous penalty points still valid." 
Question:  "What is exceptional hardship?"  Answer: "There is no set definition of exceptional hardship as it varies between cases. However, you will be required to show that disqualification would have far greater implications for you than it would for any other person facing disqualification. The fact that you will lose your job is usually insufficient. If you have relied on exceptional hardship in the past three years then you cannot rely on these facts again." 
Question:  "I have been disqualified from driving. How can I get my licence back?"  Answer: "There is a limited chance that you can appeal your disqualification. If you have been disqualified for two years or more you can apply to the Magistrates’ Court to restore your driving licence. The Magistrates’ Court will only remove your disqualification in limited circumstances. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you. We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish." 
Question:  "Do I need a solicitor or barrister?"  Answer: "If your case goes to court, you face disqualification or your case involves technical legal arguments, it is advisable to instruct a lawyer. However, you are not required to have a solicitor or barrister and you are allowed present your own case in court. In many cases defendants are confident enough to defend their case and discuss the facts; however, a legal representative is advisable to address the legal arguments which arise. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you. We can guide you on your potential options, assist you in managing your response and even refer you to a solicitor, if you so wish." 
Question:  "Once I’ve passed my driving test again will there be penalty points on my licence?"

Question:  "Can the police stop a vehicle for any reason?"  Answer: "Yes, the police can stop a vehicle for any reason. If they ask you to stop, you should always pull over when it’s safe to do so. It's against the law to not stop when asked by the police."

Question:  "Can the police ask me to take other tests if they suspect I'm under the influence?"  Answer: "Yes, if the officer thinks you're under the influence of alcohol or drugs, they can ask you to take a drug test or do a physical test, such as a ‘field impairment test’, which might include walking in a straight line then turning around and walking back." 
Question:  "What happens if I fail a drug test or a field impairment test?"  Answer: "You can be arrested if you fail a drug test or a field impairment test." 
Question:  "Can I drive my car immediately after failing a breath test?"  Answer: "No, if you fail a breath test, you cannot drive your car until you’re sober. You can ask someone else to collect your car for you." 
Question:  "A police officer issued me with a provisional fixed penalty notice. To which police station should I surrender my driving licence?"  Answer: "The provisional fixed penalty notice should tell you which police station you need to present your documents to. It is usually the police station nearest to the location where the alleged offence occurred." 
Question:  "What should I do if my vehicle has a fault, like a broken brake light?"

Question:  "What happens to the penalty points on my licence if I am disqualified for totting up 12 penalty points?"  Answer: "If you are disqualified from driving due because you have obtained 12 penalty points over three years then all penalty points are erased and you will have a clean licence once the disqualification period expires." 
Question:  "I am going to have 12 penalty points on my driving licence; will I be disqualified from driving?"  Answer: "Usually, if you incur 12 penalty points on your driving licence across three years the court will disqualify you from driving for at least six months. However, the court may not disqualify you if it would cause exceptional hardship on you or a person dependent upon you. It must be an exceptional reason and it is not enough that you would lose your job for example. 24-7LAW offers several services that may help you.

Question:  "Is it possible to get a parking operator to submit a specific piece of evidence during an appeal?",  Answer:  "During the Parking on Private Land Appeals process, while you may request specific evidence from the parking operator, it's important to understand that they are not under any legal obligation to comply with such requests. The evidence provided by both parties, you and the operator, is at your discretion. An appeal body does not have the authority to mandate that operators submit particular pieces of evidence not willingly offered."}
Question:  "What can I do if the parking operator refuses to provide the evidence I request?",  Answer:  "In cases where a parking operator refuses to provide the specific evidence you request in a Parking on Private Land Appeal, it's crucial to understand that both parties, including the operator, choose what evidence to submit. The appeal process does not include a mechanism for forcing the operator to provide particular evidence against their will. Your best course of action is to provide comprehensive evidence supporting your appeal and clearly articulate your arguments."}
Question:  "How should I approach my appeal if I know the parking operator won't provide specific evidence?",  Answer:  "When approaching a Parking on Private Land Appeal, knowing that the parking operator may not provide specific evidence you deem crucial, focus on building a robust case with the evidence and information you can provide. Highlight any inconsistencies or lack of evidence in the operator’s submission and make a compelling argument based on the evidence at hand. Remember, the operator should address each of your appeal grounds in their evidence pack, which can provide you with opportunities to strengthen your case."}
Question:  "How do I start the POPLA appeal process?",  Answer:  "To start the POPLA appeal process, you need to submit your appeal online or by post, including your 10-digit verification code provided by the parking operator and any relevant evidence. This initiates the 5-step appeals process designed to review parking disputes on private land."}
Question:  "What happens after I submit my POPLA appeal?",  Answer:  "After submitting your POPLA appeal, the case is sent to the parking operator, who has 21 days to respond with an evidence pack. This pack should address your appeal comprehensively. You will then receive this evidence pack and have 7 days to provide any comments, which must relate to the original case."}
Question:  "How is a decision made in the POPLA appeal process?",  Answer:  "A decision in the POPLA appeal process is made by an Assessor who reviews submissions from both you and the parking operator. The decision is based on the evidence and comments provided, aiming to fairly resolve the dispute. Both parties receive the decision simultaneously via email, with details accessible through your POPLA account."}
Question:  "What if I disagree with the POPLA decision?",  Answer:  "If you disagree with the POPLA decision, the appeal cannot be reconsidered by them. However, you have the option to dispute the charge further by speaking to the Citizens Advice Bureau or seeking independent legal advice. This ensures you have a pathway to contest the decision beyond the initial appeal."}
Question:  "What should I do after receiving the operator's evidence pack for a parking appeal?",  Answer:  "After receiving the operator's evidence pack for your parking appeal, you have 7 days to view and comment on it. This is your opportunity to identify and point out any discrepancies or provide additional evidence that may counter the parking operator's claims. For instance, if they assert there was signage which you know has been removed, you can use this stage to strengthen your appeal by providing evidence to the contrary. Remember, commenting on the evidence pack is optional, but it can be crucial to your appeal's success."}
Question:  "Is commenting on the evidence pack necessary?",  Answer:  "Commenting on the evidence pack provided by the parking operator in response to your appeal is optional. However, this stage gives you a chance to scrutinize their evidence and add any counter-evidence or arguments that could support your case. Even though it's not mandatory, providing comments can significantly impact the outcome of your appeal by addressing any inaccuracies or adding context that the initial appeal might not cover."}
Question:  "How can I dispute the parking operator's evidence?",  Answer:  "To dispute the parking operator's evidence presented in the evidence pack, review the documentation carefully within the 7-day viewing period. If you identify any flaws or have additional information that could invalidate their case, you can submit comments and evidence to support your claim. For example, if there is a claim about signage that you know is incorrect, presenting photographic evidence or statements can be pivotal in disputing their evidence. This process is a critical step in the appeals process and can help you make a strong case."}
Question:  "What happens if I don't comment on the evidence pack?",  Answer:  "If you choose not to comment on the evidence pack during the parking appeal process, your appeal will proceed based on the information already submitted. While commenting provides an opportunity to challenge the operator's claims with additional evidence or corrections, not doing so won't automatically harm your case. However, taking the time to review and possibly contest the evidence could strengthen your position and potentially influence the outcome in your favor."}
Question:  "Can I appeal multiple Parking Charge Notices together?",  Answer:  "No, POPLA (Parking on Private Land Appeals) requires that each Parking Charge Notice (PCN) be appealed individually. You must use the unique 10-digit verification code generated for each PCN appealed through the parking operator. Each appeal is assessed independently, necessitating the inclusion of all relevant information for each appeal separately. POPLA cannot transfer grounds and/or evidence from one appeal to another."}
Question:  "Is it possible to submit a single appeal for several PCNs on private land?",  Answer:  "Unfortunately, it is not possible to submit a single appeal for several Parking Charge Notices (PCNs) on private land. Each PCN must be appealed separately with its own unique 10-digit verification code. This is a requirement from POPLA, and each case is evaluated on its individual merits. Ensure you provide complete and relevant information for each appeal."}
Question:  "How should I handle multiple PCNs from private parking?",  Answer:  "When handling multiple Parking Charge Notices (PCNs) from private parking, each notice must be appealed individually.

You're required to submit each appeal with its unique 10-digit verification code provided by the parking operator, ensuring that all pertinent information and evidence for each PCN is included in its respective appeal."}
Question:  "For POPLA appeals, can I combine the evidence for multiple PCNs?",  Answer:  "No, for POPLA appeals, you cannot combine the evidence for multiple Parking Charge Notices (PCNs). Each PCN must be appealed on its own, utilizing the unique 10-digit verification code assigned to each. Appeals are judged on their individual merits, and it is imperative to include all relevant evidence and information distinctly for each PCN. Grounds and evidence cannot be shared or transferred between appeals."}
